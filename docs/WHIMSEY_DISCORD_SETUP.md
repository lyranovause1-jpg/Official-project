# WHIMSEY ($CNDY) — Complete Discord Server Setup Reference (Ultra-Detailed)

> This is your **single source of truth** for setting up the WHIMSEY community server. Every permission name in this document is written **exactly as it appears in the Discord app** (e.g. `Send Messages and Create Posts`, not "Send Messages"). Follow it top to bottom in the order written. Do not skip steps. Do not change the order. The order is what guarantees nothing leaks.

---

## 📖 READ — HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT

Discord uses two different permission widgets depending on where you are:

**1. Role-level (Server Settings → Roles → [Role] → Permissions tab):**
Each permission is a **simple ON/OFF toggle** (blue = ON, gray = OFF).

**2. Channel-level and Category-level (Edit Channel/Category → Permissions tab → Advanced permissions):**
Each permission is a **three-state toggle**:
- ❌ red X = **Deny** (overrides everything below; the role CANNOT do this here, even if granted server-wide)
- `/` gray slash = **Neutral / Inherit** (inherit from the next level up — for channels that means inherit from the category, and for categories that means inherit from the role's server-wide setting)
- ✅ green check = **Allow** (overrides denies from lower levels; the role CAN do this here)

**Discord's permission priority (highest wins):**
1. Server owner / Administrator permission — bypasses everything
2. Channel-level Allow ✅
3. Channel-level Deny ❌
4. Category-level Allow ✅ (inherited by channels left on Neutral)
5. Category-level Deny ❌ (inherited by channels left on Neutral)
6. Role-level server-wide ON
7. `@everyone` server-wide setting

**Throughout this document:**
- "ON" / "OFF" = role-level toggle
- "Allow ✅" / "Deny ❌" / "Neutral ➖" = channel- or category-level toggle

## 📖 THE 4 PHASES — WHICH SECTIONS TO READ vs WORK ON 🌷

This document is long because it's complete. But you don't do everything at once. Here's exactly what to do, when, and how long it takes. Follow the phases in order — don't jump ahead. ❄️

### 🅰️ PHASE A — 📖 READ ONLY (don't touch Discord yet) — ~45 min sprint

> 📖 **READ MODE — Laptop closed on Discord. Coffee in hand. Zero clicking.**

The goal of this phase is **understanding**. Sit back and absorb how everything fits together. **Do not open Discord. Do not touch any settings.** If something is confusing, re-read it — but don't try to "do" it yet. This phase is what stops you from making expensive mistakes in Phase B.

| Section | What it is | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Top intro + "How To Read This Document" | The legend (ON/OFF, Allow/Deny/Neutral, priority order) | 5 min |
| Section 2 — The Member Journey | A story walk-through: what a brand-new visitor sees vs what a verified holder sees | 10 min |
| Section 4 — Role Hierarchy | The vertical order of roles (this is the spine of everything) | 5 min |
| Sections 5–9 — Role overviews (just skim, don't toggle) | Get a feel for what each role can/can't do | 15 min |
| Section 10 — The new private categories | Understand why we need STAFF, AUDITS, MOMENTUM, TICKETS | 10 min |
| Section 28 — Carl-bot Playbook (skim) | What the autopilot brain does when you're away | 15 min |
| Section 33 — Crisis Playbook (skim) | The 22 disaster scenarios and how the doc handles them | 15 min |
| Section 34 — Bot Autopilot overview (skim only 34.1, 34.6, 34.12) | The 24/7 operating model | 10 min |

**End of Phase A:** You should be able to tell a friend "here's how my Discord server will work" in plain English. **You haven't touched Discord yet — that's correct.**

---

### 🅱️ PHASE B — BUILD THE SERVER STRUCTURE (this is the real "work") — ~8 to 10 hours

> ✅ **ACTION MODE — Open Discord. Click things. Tick boxes. This is the build.**

**2-Day Sprint:** Do Steps 1–10 on Day 1, Steps 11–18 on Day 2. Don't try to cram it all in one sitting — Discord is unforgiving when you misclick a permission. Tired eyes = wrong toggles.

This is **Steps 1 through 18 in section 1** — the 18-step setup order. Tick each box as you go. Below is the time per step:

| Step | What you're doing | Section to use | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 1 | Apply server-wide safety (AutoMod, 2FA, verification level, onboarding) | Section 3 | 15 min |
| Step 2 | Create the 4 user roles (just names + colors, no permissions yet) | Sections 5–8 | 10 min |
| Step 3 | Drag roles into vertical order | Section 4 | 5 min |
| Step 4 | Configure `Admin 💗` (just turn ON Administrator — done) | Section 5 | 2 min |
| Step 5 | Configure `Moderator ☁️` (this is the longest role — many toggles) | Section 6 | 25 min |
| Step 6 | Configure `Holder 🌌` | Section 7 | 15 min |
| Step 7 | Configure `Verified 🩵` | Section 8 | 15 min |
| Step 8 | **Lock down `@everyone`** (the most important step in the entire doc) | Section 9 | 30 min |
| Step 9 | Create 4 new private categories + all channels inside (~50 channels total) | Section 10 + 24/24A/24B/25 | 60 min |
| Step 10 | Apply category-level permissions to **all 12 categories** | Sections 16–25 | 90 min |
| Step 11 | Per-channel overrides (only the special channels listed) | Section 26 | 60 min |
| Step 12 | Invite Auth bot, position role, configure | Section 11 | 15 min |
| Step 13 | Invite Vulcan, position role, configure | Section 12 | 20 min |
| Step 14 | Invite Ticket Tool, position role, configure (ticket panel + categories) | Section 13 | 30 min |
| Step 15 | Invite Carl-bot, position role, configure base settings | Section 14 | 30 min |
| Step 16 | Confirm final bot role positioning matches section 15 | Section 15 | 5 min |
| Step 17 | Pre-launch test with a second Discord account | Section 29 | 30 min |
| Step 18 | Polish tasks (welcome message, banner, vanity URL, etc.) | Section 30 | 30 min |

**Phase B subtotal: ~8 hours of focused work.** Add 2 hours of "I-need-a-break" buffer = ~10 hours.

**End of Phase B:** Your server is ALIVE and SAFE. You could open it to the public right now and nothing would leak. But the bots aren't on autopilot yet — that's Phase C.

---

### 🅲 PHASE C — TURN ON THE 24/7 AUTOPILOT (the bots that babysit while you sleep) — ~4 to 5 hours

> ✅ **ACTION MODE — You're configuring bots. Open each bot's dashboard. Click and set.**

This is what makes WHIMSEY feel "always alive" even when you're offline. Do this **in the second half of Day 2** — after Phase B Steps 11–18 are done.

| Step | What you're doing | Section to use | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Configure all 30+ Carl-bot event-bindings (welcomes, joins, leaves, role-pings, etc.) | Section 28 | 90 min |
| C-2 | Schedule the 9 Carl-bot momentum reports (daily recap, weekly digest, monthly report, etc.) | Section 28.6 / 34.3 | 45 min |
| C-3 | Invite + configure the 5th core bot (NFT Tracker for $CNDY on-chain feed) | Section 32 + 34.7 | 30 min |
| C-4 | Set up the Tiered Alert System (Tier 1/2/3/4 — when bots ping humans) | Section 34.8 | 30 min |
| C-5 | Set up Heartbeat Monitoring (so you know if the autopilot ever dies) | Section 34.9 | 15 min |
| C-6 | Set up cross-bot rules (NFT Tracker → Carl-bot whale alerts, dump alerts) | Section 34.7.4 | 20 min |
| C-7 | Run pre-flight verification — the 8-test autopilot smoke test | Section 34.11 | 30 min |

**Phase C subtotal: ~4 hours 20 min** of focused work. Add buffer = ~5 hours.

**End of Phase C:** The bots are now your silent partners. They never sleep, never forget, never get angry. You're truly launch-ready. 💗

---

### 🅳 PHASE D — 📚 REFERENCE FOREVER (do NOT read end-to-end) — lifetime

> 📚 **REFERENCE MODE — Never read front-to-back. Search for the specific scenario you need.**

After launch, these sections are **lookup-only**. You don't read them — you Ctrl+F / search them when something specific comes up.

| Section | When to open it |
|---|---|
| Section 31 — Permission Glossary | Whenever Discord shows a permission name you've forgotten what it means |
| Section 33 — Crisis Playbook | When something goes wrong (raid, scammer, leak, mod conflict, bot offline). Find the matching scenario, follow the steps. |
| Section 34.10 — "Humans Needed" Checklist | Once a week, to remind the team what their ~30 min/week of human work is |
| Section 26 — Per-Channel Overrides | Whenever you add a new channel and need to know what overrides to apply |
| Section 28 — Carl-bot Playbook | Whenever you want to add or change an automated rule |

**You will open these sections dozens of times over the life of the server. That's the right way to use them.**

---

### ⏱️ TOTAL TIME SUMMARY

| Phase | What it is | Total time |
|---|---|---|
| 🅰️ Phase A — 📖 READ | Understand how it all works | **~45 min** (sprint version) |
| 🅱️ Phase B — ✅ DO | The 18-step setup of the server itself | **~8–9 hours** |
| 🅲 Phase C — ✅ DO | Configure the bot brain that runs 24/7 | **~3.5–4 hours** |
| 🅳 Phase D — 📚 REFERENCE | Lookup-only forever | **0 hours upfront** |
| | | |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | Phase A + B + C | **~12 hours of focused work** |

---

### 🗓️ YOUR 2-DAY SPRINT PLAN (6 hours each day — start to launch-ready)

| ✅ | **DO** | Action steps — click, toggle, configure, tick boxes | Discord open (or a bot dashboard open) |
| 📚 | **REFERENCE** | Look up when something specific happens — never read front-to-back | Open only when you need it |

**Every section mapped:**

| Section | Mode | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Top intro + "How To Read" | 📖 READ | The legend itself — you're reading it now |
| **Section 1** | ✅ DO | The 18-step build checklist — your tick-off list |
| **Section 2** | 📖 READ | Member journey story — what a visitor actually sees |
| **Section 3** | ✅ DO | Server-wide safety settings (AutoMod, 2FA, verification) |
| **Section 4** | 📖 READ | Role hierarchy — understand the spine of the system |
| **Sections 5–9** | ✅ DO | Configure each role's permissions (toggle in Discord → Roles) |
| **Section 10** | ✅ DO | Create the 4 private categories + all 50ish channels |
| **Sections 11–15** | ✅ DO | Invite + configure each of the 4 bots |

## 📖 READ — PRE-MINT TIMING (read this first!) 🌷💗

**The WHIMSEY collection mint is in ~15 days. The collection is NOT live on-chain yet.**

That's actually perfect — the Discord server build is part of the pre-mint build process. Here's what that means for this checklist:

### ✅ What you CAN do RIGHT NOW (the next 15 days, before mint)

**99% of this checklist is pre-mint work.** Do it all now:

- ✅ All of **Phase B** (server structure, roles, permissions, channels, categories, lockdown).
- ✅ All of **Phase C** EXCEPT one item — the NFT Tracker (5th bot).
- ✅ All Carl-bot autopilot rules — they're agnostic to whether the collection has minted yet.
- ✅ All ticket-tool, AutoMod, audit-channel, and momentum-channel setup.
- ✅ All daily/weekly/monthly Carl-bot scheduled reports — they'll start collecting community engagement data immediately.
- ✅ All pre-flight smoke tests EXCEPT the on-chain test in C-3.11.

### ⏸️ What WAITS until mint day (1 single item — but you can prep it now)

The **NFT Tracker bot (Step C-3)** can be **invited and configured now**, but it won't have anything real to track until mint goes live. You have 2 options:

**Option 1 (recommended):** Invite + configure NFT Tracker now using your **placeholder contract address** (or your testnet contract if you have one). On mint day, simply update the contract address in the bot dashboard — everything else is already wired up. Total post-mint work: ~5 minutes.

**Option 2:** Skip Step C-3 entirely until mint day. Then do all 11 sub-steps on launch day.

→ **Pick Option 1.** You don't want to be debugging bot setup at 3am on mint day. Set it up now with placeholders, swap the contract on mint day. ❄️

### 📅 Your 2-day pre-mint build calendar

You have **2 days × 6 hours = 12 hours** to get from zero to fully-automated Discord server. Here's how it fits:

| Day | What you do | Mode | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Day 1 — morning/afternoon** | Phase A: Critical reading (sections 2, 4, skim 28 intro) | 📖 READ | 45 min |
| **Day 1 — continued** | Phase B Steps 1–8: Server safety, all 4 roles, @everyone lockdown | ✅ DO | ~2 hrs |
| **Day 1 — continued** | Phase B Step 9: Create all 4 private categories + ~50 channels | ✅ DO | ~1 hr |
| **Day 1 — continued** | Phase B Step 10: All 12 category permission tables | ✅ DO | ~1.5 hrs |
| **Day 1 — end** | Sanity check with 2nd account | ✅ DO | 20 min |
| **Day 2 — morning** | Phase B Steps 11–18: Per-channel overrides, 4 bots, test, polish | ✅ DO | ~3 hrs |
| **Day 2 — afternoon** | Phase C C-1 + C-2: All Carl-bot bindings + 9 schedules | ✅ DO | ~2.5 hrs |
| **Day 2 — evening** | Phase C C-3 through C-7: NFT Tracker + alerts + smoke test | ✅ DO | ~1 hr |
| **After Day 2** | Soft launch with 20 friends. Watch audit channels. Fix any leaks. | ✅ DO | passive |
| **Mint day** | Update NFT Tracker contract address (5 min). Open public invite. 🌷💗❄️🌌🩵 | ✅ DO | ~5 min + vibes |

**Don't rush.** Don't skip steps. The permission tables in Step 10 are the most tedious part — put on a playlist and go methodically. One wrong toggle = a channel that leaks to everyone.

---

## ✅ THE MEGA WORKING-PHASE CHECKLIST — TICK EVERY BOX 💗

This is the granular, hand-held version of Phase B + Phase C. Every line is one micro-action. Tick it off as you go. If you have to stop mid-day, you'll know exactly where to resume tomorrow.

> 💡 **Tip:** This doc is the master reference, but for actually ticking off boxes, use the **interactive checklist app** (built as a separate piece — your progress saves automatically to your browser, so you can close the tab and come back tomorrow without losing anything). 🩵

---

### 🅱️ PHASE B — SERVER BUILD CHECKLIST (~8–10 hours total)

#### ☑️ STEP 1 — Server-wide safety configuration (~15 min) — Section 3

- [ ] 1.1 Open Discord → click your server name → **Server Settings**.
- [ ] 1.2 Go to **Safety Setup** → set **Verification Level** to `High` (must have a verified phone number).
- [ ] 1.3 Set **Explicit Media Content Filter** to `Scan messages from all members`.
- [ ] 1.4 Set **Default Notification Settings** to `Only @mentions`.
- [ ] 1.5 Go to **AutoMod** → enable `Block Commonly Flagged Words` (use Discord's preset list).
- [ ] 1.6 In AutoMod → enable `Block Mention Spam` → set to `5 mentions per message`.
- [ ] 1.7 In AutoMod → enable `Block Spam Content` (covers repeated/zalgo).
- [ ] 1.8 In AutoMod → add a **Custom Keyword** rule: block words like `airdrop`, `claim`, `mint live`, `free WHIMSEY`, `support DM`, `seed phrase`, `private key`. Action: **Block + Timeout 1 hour**.
- [ ] 1.9 Go to **Server Settings → Safety Setup → Require 2FA for moderator actions** → ON.
- [ ] 1.10 Confirm YOUR account has 2FA enabled (Discord User Settings → My Account → Enable 2FA).
- [ ] 1.11 Go to **Server Settings → Onboarding** → enable Onboarding → leave the actual onboarding question setup for Step 18.

#### ☑️ STEP 2 — Create the 4 user roles (~10 min) — Sections 5–8

Just create them with name + color. Do NOT touch any permissions yet.

- [ ] 2.1 Server Settings → **Roles** → `Create Role` → name: `Admin 💗` → color: pink/rose → display separately ON.
- [ ] 2.2 Create role: `Moderator ☁️` → color: light blue → display separately ON.
- [ ] 2.3 Create role: `Holder 🌌` → color: deep purple/galaxy → display separately ON.
- [ ] 2.4 Create role: `Verified 🩵` → color: cyan/baby blue → display separately ON.

#### ☑️ STEP 3 — Drag roles into vertical order (~5 min) — Section 4

- [ ] 3.1 In Server Settings → Roles, drag the roles so the top-down order is exactly: `Admin 💗` → `Moderator ☁️` → `Holder 🌌` → `Verified 🩵` → `@everyone`.
- [ ] 3.2 Bots will be added later — leave gaps mentally between Mod and Holder for them.

#### ☑️ STEP 4 — Configure `Admin 💗` (~2 min) — Section 5

- [ ] 4.1 Click `Admin 💗` → Permissions tab → toggle **Administrator** ON.
- [ ] 4.2 That's it. Save.

#### ☑️ STEP 5 — Configure `Moderator ☁️` (~25 min) — Section 6

- [ ] 5.1 Open `Moderator ☁️` → Permissions tab.
- [ ] 5.2 Open Section 6 of this doc side-by-side.
- [ ] 5.3 Toggle **every single permission** to match the ON/OFF column in Section 6. Take your time.
- [ ] 5.4 Double-check: `Administrator` is **OFF**. (Mods are not admins.)
- [ ] 5.5 Double-check: `Manage Server`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Channels` are **OFF**.
- [ ] 5.6 Double-check: `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Timeout Members`, `Manage Messages`, `Manage Threads` are **ON**.
- [ ] 5.7 Save.

#### ☑️ STEP 6 — Configure `Holder 🌌` (~15 min) — Section 7

- [ ] 6.1 Open `Holder 🌌` → Permissions tab.
- [ ] 6.2 Toggle every permission per Section 7's table.
- [ ] 6.3 Double-check: NO moderation perms (no kick/ban/manage anything).
- [ ] 6.4 Double-check: `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Add Reactions`, `Use External Emojis`, `Use External Stickers`, `Connect`, `Speak`, `Use Voice Activity` are **ON**.
- [ ] 6.5 Save.

#### ☑️ STEP 7 — Configure `Verified 🩵` (~15 min) — Section 8

- [ ] 7.1 Open `Verified 🩵` → Permissions tab.
- [ ] 7.2 Toggle every permission per Section 8's table.
- [ ] 7.3 Double-check: this role is even more restricted than Holder (no `Embed Links`, no `Attach Files` server-wide — those are channel-allowed only).
- [ ] 7.4 Save.

#### ☑️ STEP 8 — Lock down `@everyone` (~30 min) — Section 9 — **MOST IMPORTANT STEP**

- [ ] 8.1 Open `@everyone` → Permissions tab.
- [ ] 8.2 Open Section 9 side-by-side.
- [ ] 8.3 Toggle **EVERY** permission to **OFF** except the tiny handful Section 9 says to leave ON (typically: `View Channels`, `Read Message History` — and even these get denied at category level for private categories).
- [ ] 8.4 Double-check: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`, `Add Reactions`, `Speak`, `Connect`, `Mention @everyone`, `Use External Emojis`, `Use Application Commands` are all **OFF** server-wide.
- [ ] 8.5 Save. **This is the lockdown that guarantees nothing leaks.**

#### ☑️ STEP 9 — Create the 4 new private categories + ~50 channels (~60 min) — Section 10 + 24/24A/24B/25

- [ ] 9.1 Create category `🔒 | STAFF` (private). Add channels per section 24 (e.g. `#staff-chat`, `#mod-log`, `#admin-only`, etc.).
- [ ] 9.2 Create category `📋 | AUDITS` (private). Add **all 20** audit channels per section 24A (`#audit-mod-actions`, `#audit-joins-leaves`, `#audit-message-edits`, etc.).
- [ ] 9.3 Create category `📈 | MOMENTUM` (private). Add **all 8** momentum channels per section 24B (`#momentum-server-stats`, `#momentum-collection-feed`, `#momentum-daily-recap`, etc.).
- [ ] 9.4 Create category `🎫 | TICKETS` (private). Add channels per section 25 (`#open-tickets`, `#ticket-archive`, etc.).
- [ ] 9.5 Verify all 4 categories show a 🔒 lock icon next to their name (means private).
- [ ] 9.6 Verify the 8 PUBLIC categories from your existing structure are still there: `💗 | VERIFY`, `🌊 | START HERE`, `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE`, `📌 | COMMUNITY`, `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`, `🌷 | COLLECTORS`, `🩵 | EVENTS`, `☁️ | SUPPORT`.

#### ☑️ STEP 10 — Apply category-level permissions to ALL 12 categories (~90 min) — Sections 16–25

Do this for each category in order. Open the section side-by-side and toggle every cell.

- [ ] 10.1 `💗 | VERIFY` (section 16) — apply per-role Allow/Deny/Neutral table.
- [ ] 10.2 `🌊 | START HERE` (section 17).
- [ ] 10.3 `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE` (section 18).
- [ ] 10.4 `📌 | COMMUNITY` (section 19).
- [ ] 10.5 `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY` (section 20).
- [ ] 10.6 `🌷 | COLLECTORS` (section 21).
- [ ] 10.7 `🩵 | EVENTS` (section 22).
- [ ] 10.8 `☁️ | SUPPORT` (section 23).
- [ ] 10.9 `🔒 | STAFF` (section 24).
- [ ] 10.10 `📋 | AUDITS` (section 24A).
- [ ] 10.11 `📈 | MOMENTUM` (section 24B).
- [ ] 10.12 `🎫 | TICKETS` (section 25).
- [ ] 10.13 **Sanity check:** open the server with NO roles (use a second Discord account or an incognito role-swap) — you should see only `#welcome` / `#access-info` / `#verify`. If you see anything else, a permission leaked. Find it and fix it.

#### ☑️ STEP 11 — Per-channel overrides (~60 min) — Section 26

Only apply overrides to the channels listed in section 26 — not every channel.

- [ ] 11.1 Open section 26. It lists every channel that needs special rules beyond category defaults.
- [ ] 11.2 For each listed channel: ⚙️ Edit Channel → Permissions → apply the override exactly as written.
- [ ] 11.3 Pay extra attention to **AUDITS channels**: bots get `Send Messages` Allow ✅, mods get `Send Messages` **Deny ❌** (mods react only, never type — keeps the log clean).
- [ ] 11.4 Pay extra attention to **MOMENTUM channels**: team CAN comment here (unlike audits).
- [ ] 11.5 Tick off each channel in section 26 as you finish it.

#### ☑️ STEP 12 — Invite + configure Auth bot (~15 min) — Section 11

- [ ] 12.1 Go to the Auth bot's invite URL (in section 11).
- [ ] 12.2 Grant ONLY the OAuth scopes section 11 lists. Untick everything else.
- [ ] 12.3 In Server Settings → Roles, drag the Auth role into the position section 15 specifies.
- [ ] 12.4 Open `#verify` → run the Auth setup command per section 11.
- [ ] 12.5 Verify the Auth panel posts in `#verify`.

#### ☑️ STEP 13 — Invite + configure Vulcan (~20 min) — Section 12

- [ ] 13.1 Invite Vulcan via section 12's URL with only the listed perms.
- [ ] 13.2 Drag Vulcan role into position per section 15.
- [ ] 13.3 In Vulcan's dashboard (vulcan.xyz), connect your $CNDY contract address.
- [ ] 13.4 Set the role it grants on successful holder verification = `Holder 🌌`.
- [ ] 13.5 Bind the verification command to `#holder-verify` (or the channel section 12 lists).

#### ☑️ STEP 14 — Invite + configure Ticket Tool (~30 min) — Section 13

- [ ] 14.1 Invite Ticket Tool via section 13's URL with only the listed perms.
- [ ] 14.2 Drag its role into position per section 15.
- [ ] 14.3 Set the **ticket category** = `🎫 | TICKETS`.
- [ ] 14.4 Set the **transcript channel** = `#ticket-archive`.
- [ ] 14.5 Set **support role** = `Moderator ☁️` (so mods see opened tickets).
- [ ] 14.6 Create the **ticket panel** with the buttons section 13 specifies (e.g. "Wallet help", "Scam report", "Bug report", "General").
- [ ] 14.7 Add the saved replies from section 28.5 (I-need-wallet, Scam-confirmed, Closing-no-response).
- [ ] 14.8 Post the ticket panel in `#open-tickets`.

#### ☑️ STEP 15 — Invite + configure Carl-bot base (~30 min) — Section 14

- [ ] 15.1 Invite Carl-bot via section 14's URL with the listed perms (it needs more than other bots).
- [ ] 15.2 Drag the Carl-bot role into position per section 15.
- [ ] 15.3 Open carl.gg dashboard → select your server.
- [ ] 15.4 Configure base settings: prefix, embed color (use WHIMSEY brand color), default mute role.
- [ ] 15.5 Configure logging channel = `#audit-mod-actions`.
- [ ] 15.6 The deep configuration (30+ event-bindings, 9 schedules) happens in **Phase C** below — don't try to do it now.

#### ☑️ STEP 16 — Confirm final bot role positioning (~5 min) — Section 15

- [ ] 16.1 Open Server Settings → Roles.
- [ ] 16.2 Verify the top-down order matches section 15 exactly: `Admin 💗` → `Moderator ☁️` → `Carl-bot` → `Auth` → `Vulcan` → `Ticket Tool` → (NFT Tracker will go here at #6 in Phase C) → `Holder 🌌` → `Verified 🩵` → `@everyone`.
- [ ] 16.3 If any role is out of place, drag it. Bot order matters — a bot can only assign roles below itself.

#### ☑️ STEP 17 — Pre-launch test with a 2nd Discord account (~30 min) — Section 29

- [ ] 17.1 Open a second Discord account (phone, browser, alt email — anything).
- [ ] 17.2 Join your server with the second account.
- [ ] 17.3 Confirm: you land in `#access-info` and see ONLY verify-related channels.
- [ ] 17.4 Click verify in `#verify` → complete captcha → get `Verified 🩵` role automatically.
- [ ] 17.5 Confirm: you can now see public categories but NOT staff/audits/momentum/tickets.
- [ ] 17.6 Try to send a message in `#announcements` — it should be blocked (Verified can't post there).
- [ ] 17.7 Connect a wallet via Vulcan (use a wallet that holds $CNDY) — get `Holder 🌌` role.
- [ ] 17.8 Confirm: `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY` category now visible.
- [ ] 17.9 Open a ticket via `#open-tickets` → confirm it spawns a private channel and pings mods.
- [ ] 17.10 Walk through every issue you find and fix it now, not after launch.

#### ☑️ STEP 18 — Polish tasks (~30 min) — Section 30

- [ ] 18.1 Set server icon (high-res WHIMSEY logo).
- [ ] 18.2 Set server banner (cool-cats-quality artwork).
- [ ] 18.3 Set splash screen (the image people see when they get an invite link).
- [ ] 18.4 Configure a vanity URL (`discord.gg/whimsey` if available).
- [ ] 18.5 Set up the **Welcome Screen** (Server Settings → Welcome Screen) — describe each public channel in 1 sentence.
- [ ] 18.6 Set up **Onboarding questions** (Server Settings → Onboarding) — opt-in tags like "I'm an artist", "I'm a trader", "I'm here for vibes".
- [ ] 18.7 Pin a welcome message in `#welcome` written in your brand voice (doodles + soft + warm).
- [ ] 18.8 Pin the holder-verify instructions in `#holder-verify`.
- [ ] 18.9 Test invite link in incognito browser one more time.

✅ **PHASE B COMPLETE.** Your server is alive, locked down, and ready for humans. But the autopilot brain isn't on yet — that's Phase C below. 🌷

### 🅲 PHASE C — AUTOPILOT CHECKLIST (~4–5 hours total)

#### ☑️ STEP C-1 — Configure all Carl-bot event-bindings (~90 min) — Section 28

Open section 28 side-by-side. Each event-binding gets one tick.

- [ ] C-1.30 Bad-word filter custom list (in addition to AutoMod default).

#### ☑️ STEP C-2 — Schedule the 9 Carl-bot momentum reports (~45 min) — Section 28.6 / 34.3

- [ ] C-2.1 **Daily recap** at 9pm IST → posts to `#momentum-daily-recap`.
- [ ] C-2.2 **Daily on-chain rollup** appended to daily recap (sales/listings/whales/mints/volume).
- [ ] C-2.3 **Weekly digest** every Monday 10am IST → `#momentum-weekly-digest`.

- [ ] C-2.9 **Engagement heat map** end of month → `#momentum-engagement`.

#### ☑️ STEP C-3 — Invite + configure NFT Tracker (~30 min) — Section 32 + 34.7

- [ ] C-3.1 Invite NFTSalesBot (ETH/Polygon) OR Hashlist (Solana) — pick one.
- [ ] C-3.2 OAuth: tick ONLY View Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files, Read Message History, Use External Emojis. Untick everything else.
- [ ] C-3.3 Drag NFT Tracker role to position **#6** (under Ticket Tool, above `Holder 🌌`).
- [ ] C-3.4 Strip every server-wide permission — channel-allow only.
- [ ] C-3.5 In `#momentum-collection-feed` → ⚙️ → add NFT Tracker with View/Send/Embed/Attach/History/External Emojis Allow ✅.
- [ ] C-3.6 In bot dashboard: paste contract address, set output channel = `#momentum-collection-feed`.
- [ ] C-3.7 Tick events: ✅ Sales ✅ Listings ✅ De-listings ✅ Transfers ✅ Mints.
- [ ] C-3.8 Set marketplaces: ✅ OpenSea ✅ Magic Eden ✅ Blur ✅ LooksRare ✅ X2Y2.
- [ ] C-3.9 Currency display: ETH primary, INR secondary.
- [ ] C-3.10 Configure auto-tag emoji prefixes: 🛒 / 🐋 / 🏷️ / ⏸️ / 🔄 / ✨ / 📉.
- [ ] C-3.11 Test: do a tiny test transfer of $CNDY between two wallets — verify the embed shows up in `#momentum-collection-feed` within 60 seconds.

#### ☑️ STEP C-4 — Set up the Tiered Alert System (~30 min) — Section 34.8

- [ ] C-4.1 Tier 1 (silent log only) — confirm AutoMod hits, message edits, reaction adds, etc. log silently to audit channels with NO ping.
- [ ] C-4.2 Tier 2 (ping `@Moderator` in `#staff-chat`) — configure: spam detection, suspicious links, mass mentions, new-account joins, ticket opened.
- [ ] C-4.3 Tier 3 (ping `@Admin` in `#staff-chat`) — configure: channel/role/permission/webhook/bot changes, anti-raid trigger, whale wallet sells 10+ in 60 min, floor drops 30% in 60 min.
- [ ] C-4.4 Tier 4 (ping `@everyone` in `#staff-chat`, NOT public) — configure: server outage, bot mass-failure, confirmed token compromise. **Test the trigger but don't actually fire it.**
- [ ] C-4.5 Cross-bot rule 1: 20+ sale embeds in 10 min in `#momentum-collection-feed` → Carl-bot pings `@Moderator` ("floor may be moving fast").
- [ ] C-4.6 Cross-bot rule 2: same wallet appears as buyer in 5+ embeds in 60 min → Carl-bot pings `@Moderator` ("🐋 whale alert").

#### ☑️ STEP C-5 — Set up Heartbeat Monitoring (~15 min) — Section 34.9

- [ ] C-5.1 Carl-bot scheduled job: every hour at :00, post `✅ Heartbeat` in `#audit-mod-actions`.
- [ ] C-5.2 Configure `@Admin` notification: if no heartbeat for 90 min → DM Admin "Carl-bot may be offline."
- [ ] C-5.3 NFT Tracker heartbeat: every 4 hours, check if any embed posted; if empty + on-chain activity exists → ping `@Admin`.

#### ☑️ STEP C-6 — Cross-bot rules (covered above in C-4.5 / C-4.6) — Section 34.7.4

- [ ] C-6.1 Verify the whale-alert rule fires on a test scenario.
- [ ] C-6.2 Verify the floor-crash rule fires on a test scenario (use a sandbox if possible, or just inspect the rule logic).

#### ☑️ STEP C-7 — Pre-flight verification (the 8-test smoke test) (~30 min) — Section 34.11

- [ ] C-7.1 Test 1: Verify flow with second account works end-to-end.
- [ ] C-7.2 Test 2: A test message in any audit channel from a mod is BLOCKED (mods deny send).
- [ ] C-7.3 Test 3: Carl-bot heartbeat posts at the next :00.
- [ ] C-7.4 Test 4: NFT Tracker posts within 60 sec of a test on-chain event.
- [ ] C-7.5 Test 5: Daily recap fires at 9pm IST (you can manually trigger it once for testing).
- [ ] C-7.6 Test 6: A Tier 3 trigger correctly pings `@Admin` in `#staff-chat`.
- [ ] C-7.7 Test 7: Anti-raid lockdown triggers at 10+ joins/60sec (use 10 alt accounts OR inspect the rule).
- [ ] C-7.8 Test 8: Open a ticket → it spawns + mods get pinged + saved replies are accessible.

✅ **PHASE C COMPLETE.** Autopilot is live. The server now runs itself when you sleep. 💗❄️🌌🩵

## ✅ DO — 1) THE 18-STEP SETUP ORDER

Tick each step as you finish it. Do NOT do them out of order.

- [ ] **Step 1.** Apply server-wide safety configuration (section 3).
- [ ] **Step 2.** Create the 4 roles (sections 5–8) with NO permissions toggled yet — just the name + color + display settings.
- [ ] **Step 3.** Drag the roles into the correct vertical order (section 4 — bots will be added later, but place the user roles now).
- [ ] **Step 4.** Configure `Admin 💗` permissions (section 5) — turn ON Administrator, done.
- [ ] **Step 5.** Configure `Moderator ☁️` permissions (section 6) — toggle every permission per the table.
- [ ] **Step 6.** Configure `Holder 🌌` permissions (section 7).
- [ ] **Step 7.** Configure `Verified 🩵` permissions (section 8).
- [ ] **Step 8.** Lock down `@everyone` (section 9). This is the most important step.
- [ ] **Step 9.** Create the 4 new private categories `🔒 | STAFF`, `📋 | AUDITS`, `📈 | MOMENTUM`, and `🎫 | TICKETS` and all the channels inside them (section 10).
- [ ] **Step 10.** Apply category-level permissions to ALL 12 categories (sections 16–25). Do all of these BEFORE touching individual channels.
- [ ] **Step 11.** Apply per-channel overrides only to the channels listed in section 26.
- [ ] **Step 12.** Invite Auth bot (section 11). Drag its role into position. Configure it.
- [ ] **Step 13.** Invite Vulcan (section 12). Drag its role into position. Configure it.
- [ ] **Step 14.** Invite Ticket Tool (section 13). Drag its role into position. Configure it.
- [ ] **Step 15.** Invite Carl-bot (section 14). Drag its role into position. Configure it (this is the longest configuration).
- [ ] **Step 16.** Confirm the final bot role positioning (section 15).
- [ ] **Step 17.** Run the pre-launch test checklist with a second Discord account (section 29).
- [ ] **Step 18.** Polish tasks (section 30). Then publish the invite link.

## 📖 READ — 2) THE MEMBER JOURNEY (WHAT YOUR PERMISSIONS MUST PRODUCE)

This is the experience your server has to enforce. Every permission decision below exists to make this story work.

**Stage 0 — A user clicks the invite link.**
- Discord shows them the membership-screening rules.
- They accept.
- They land in the server with only the `@everyone` role.

**Stage 1 — Brand-new joiner (only `@everyone`).**
- Sees ONLY the `💗 | VERIFY` category (everything else is hidden).
- The first channel visible at the top of their channel list is `#access-info`.
- They read `#access-info`, which tells them to go to `#verify`.
- In `#verify`, the Auth bot's panel is pinned at the top with a button.
- They click the button, complete a captcha.
- Auth bot assigns them the `Verified 🩵` role automatically.

**Stage 2 — `Verified 🩵` member.**
- ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: The `💗 | VERIFY` category stays ALWAYS VISIBLE — members can always return to `#access-info` and `#verify`. Do NOT deny View Channels for Verified 🩵 or Holder 🌌 here.
- All public categories also appear, in this order: `🌊 | START HERE` → `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE` → `📌 | COMMUNITY` → `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY` (only `#holder-verify` visible) → `🌷 | COLLECTORS` → `🩵 | EVENTS` → `☁️ | SUPPORT`.
- They are auto-pointed to `#rules`. After reading, they go to `#welcome`.
- They can chat in `#general-chat`, `#whimsey-talk`, `#fan-creations`, `#suggestions`, `#show-your-whimsey`, `#trading-post`, `#market-talk`, `#support`.
- They can open private support tickets from `#open-tickets`.
- They can react (but not write) in `#announcements`, `#whimsey-of-the-day`, `#giveaways`, `#polls`, `#faqs`, `#scam-alerts`, and every channel in `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE`.
- If they want to claim Holder status, they go to `#holder-verify` and connect their wallet via Vulcan.

**Stage 3 — `Holder 🌌` member (Vulcan confirmed they own a $CNDY NFT).**
- `#holder-chat` and `#holder-announcements` appear inside `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`.
- They can chat in `#holder-chat` and react in `#holder-announcements`.
- Everything from Stage 2 still works.
- Vulcan re-checks every 24 hours. If they sell their NFT, the role is auto-removed and the holder channels disappear again.

**Stage 4 — `Moderator ☁️` (your team).**
- Sees everything Holders see, plus the new private categories `🔒 | STAFF` and `🎫 | TICKETS`.
- Can delete messages, kick, ban, time out, manage threads, manage events.
- Cannot manage the server, manage roles, or grant Administrator.

**Stage 5 — `Admin 💗` (you).**
- Has Administrator. Bypasses every restriction. Sees everything.

The clarification on `#support` vs `#open-tickets` you asked for:
- **`#support`** is the OPEN public help channel. Members ASK questions here. Other members + mods + Carl-bot's auto-responder can answer publicly. Use it for "How do I verify?", "Where is the roadmap?" — public, repeated questions.
- **`#open-tickets`** is the entry point to PRIVATE 1-on-1 help. Members click the Ticket Tool button, which spawns a private channel inside `🎫 | TICKETS` only they + the team + Ticket Tool can see. Use it for sensitive issues — wallet problems, scam reports, holder verification failures, payment issues, harassment reports.

---

## ✅ DO — 3) SERVER-WIDE SAFETY CONFIGURATION

Do this BEFORE touching roles. Open **Server Settings → Safety Setup**.

### 3.1) Verification Level
Set to **High** — "Member must also be registered on Discord for longer than 10 minutes."
- *Why:* blocks fresh throwaway accounts (the #1 vector for raid bots and scam bots in NFT servers).

### 3.2) Explicit Media Filter
Set to **Filter messages from all members**.
- *Why:* auto-deletes any image Discord's classifier flags as explicit. Your community will include minors and a clean filter is mandatory for Server Discovery later.

### 3.3) DM Spam Filter
Set to **Filter all direct messages**.
- *Why:* auto-scans DMs for spam/scam content. Doesn't stop DMs entirely (you can't, only the recipient can), but flags obvious scams.

### 3.4) Membership Screening (Server Settings → Membership Screening)
Enable it. Add these 3 questions/rules the user must agree to before joining:
1. "I have read the rules and will follow them."
2. "I understand the WHIMSEY team will NEVER DM me first."
3. "I will never share my wallet seed phrase with anyone — including anyone claiming to be the team."

### 3.5) Onboarding (Server Settings → Onboarding)
Enable it. Set up:
- **Default channels** new members see: only `#access-info` and `#verify`.
- **Customize-your-experience tags** (optional but recommended): "I'm a $CNDY holder", "I'm here for art", "I'm here to trade", "I'm here for community". These map to optional self-assigned roles you can add later.

### 3.6) AutoMod (Server Settings → AutoMod)
Turn ON these built-in rules:
- **Block commonly flagged words** — ON (preset 1: Sexual content, preset 2: Severe profanity, preset 3: Slurs).
- **Block mention spam** — ON. Set max mentions per message to **5**.
- **Block spam content** — ON.
- **Custom keyword filter** — create a new rule called `Scam keywords` and paste:
  - `free mint`, `claim airdrop`, `dm me for support`, `team support here`, `verify your wallet at`, `metamask support`, `phantom support`, `seed phrase`, `connect your wallet here`, `private mint pass`, `whitelist giveaway dm`, `you have been selected`
  - Action: **Block message** + **Send alert message** to `#scam-watch` (created in section 10).

### 3.7) Two-Factor Authentication for Moderation
**Server Settings → Safety Setup → Require 2FA for moderation actions** → ON.
- *Why:* Moderators MUST have 2FA enabled on their personal Discord account or they can't kick/ban/delete. Stops compromised mod accounts from nuking the server.

### 3.8) Community Server Settings (you said you've already enabled Community)
Make sure these are set:
- **Rules channel** → `#rules`
- **Community updates channel** → `#discord-updates` (⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: use the private `#discord-updates` channel in `🔒 | STAFF` — NOT `#staff-announcements` — so Discord platform updates stay private)
- **System messages channel** → `#momentum-member-joins` (⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: use this private channel in `📈 | MOMENTUM` — join notifications stay private, not broadcast publicly to `#welcome`)

---

## 📖 READ — 4) ROLE HIERARCHY — THE EXACT VERTICAL ORDER

After Step 2 you'll have only the user roles. After all 4 bots are invited, your hierarchy must look exactly like this (top = highest power):

```
1.   WHIMSEY BUILDING           ← ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION — sits ABOVE Admin 💗
2.   WHIMSEY AI                 ← ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION — sits ABOVE Admin 💗
3.   Admin 💗
4.   Moderator ☁️
5.   Carl-bot                  ← bot role auto-created when you invite Carl-bot
6.   Auth                       ← bot role auto-created when you invite Auth
7.   Vulcan                     ← bot role auto-created when you invite Vulcan
8.   Ticket Tool                ← bot role auto-created when you invite Ticket Tool
9.   Holder 🌌
10.  Verified 🩵
11.  @everyone                  ← cannot be moved
```

**Why this order:**
- ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: `WHIMSEY AI` and `WHIMSEY BUILDING` sit at the very TOP — above even `Admin 💗` — so they have full operational access to all roles, channels, and server actions. This is intentional and permanent.
- A role can only manage roles BELOW it. Bots inherit this rule.
- `Auth` MUST sit above `Verified 🩵` so it can assign that role.
- `Vulcan` MUST sit above `Holder 🌌` so it can assign that role.
- `Carl-bot` sits above `Auth`/`Vulcan`/`Ticket Tool` so it can manage them in emergencies (delete a stuck role, etc.).
- All non-WHIMSEY bots sit BELOW `Moderator ☁️` so the human team can override / kick / re-invite the bot if it ever misbehaves or its token gets compromised.
- `Admin 💗` (Lyra) has Administrator permission which bypasses everything in practice.

To re-order: **Server Settings → Roles → drag with the handle on the left.**

## ✅ DO — 5) ROLE 1 — `Admin 💗`

**Color:** Pink (use Discord's default pink, or hex `#FF66B2` for a custom one).
**Display role members separately from online members:** ✅ ON
**Allow anyone to @mention this role:** ❌ OFF
**Assigned to:** You.

**Permissions:** Toggle ON the single permission below. That's it. Administrator overrides every other check.

| Permission | ON / OFF |
|---|---|
| Administrator | **ON** |

> Discord will visually grey out the rest of the toggles once Administrator is ON, because they all become moot. Done.

## ✅ DO — 6) ROLE 2 — `Moderator ☁️`

**Color:** Light blue / cloud (hex `#A8D8FF` or Discord's default light blue).
**Display role members separately from online members:** ✅ ON
**Allow anyone to @mention this role:** ❌ OFF (only Admin and other Mods should ping the team).

## ✅ DO — 7) ROLE 3 — `Holder 🌌`

**Color:** Galaxy purple (hex `#5B2A86`).
**Display role members separately from online members:** ❌ OFF
**Allow anyone to @mention this role:** ❌ OFF (only mods/admin should ping holders, e.g. for snapshot announcements).
**Assigned by:** Vulcan bot (NEVER manually).

This role's power comes from **what it can SEE** (channel-level Allows in section 20), not from server-wide permissions. At the role level, Holders are basically a slightly trusted Verified — same toggles.

## ✅ DO — 8) ROLE 4 — `Verified 🩵`

**Color:** Sky blue (hex `#7EC8E3`).
**Display role members separately from online members:** ❌ OFF
**Allow anyone to @mention this role:** ❌ OFF.
**Assigned by:** Auth bot (NEVER manually).

The toggles below are **identical** to Holder. The Holder vs Verified split is enforced entirely by **channel visibility** (handled in sections 20 and 26), not by role-level toggles.

## ✅ DO — 9) `@everyone` — THE SERVER-WIDE LOCKDOWN

This is the most important table in the entire document. Every fresh joiner has only `@everyone`. We deny everything by default and re-grant access in specific places via roles + category overrides.

Open **Server Settings → Roles → @everyone → Permissions tab**.

### General Server Permissions

---

## ✅ DO — 10) NEW PRIVATE CATEGORIES YOU MUST CREATE

You currently have 8 categories. Add these **4 NEW** categories for staff chat, granular event auditing, real-time momentum tracking, and ticket support. Position them at the **bottom of your category list** — regular members can't see them anyway, so it keeps the sidebar tidy for the team.

The audit philosophy here: **one channel per event type**, never mixed. That way if you ever need to investigate "what happened to that role last Tuesday" you go to ONE channel and scroll, instead of fishing through a wall of mixed logs.

### Category 9: `🔒 | STAFF`

The team's private discussion area. Kept lean — only chat-style channels. All logging lives in `📋 | AUDITS`.

| Channel | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `#staff-chat` | Text | The team's private discussion space. |
| `#staff-announcements` | Announcement | You post directives to the team here. Mods can react but not post. |
| `#mod-commands` | Text | Mods run bot slash commands here so public channels stay clean. |
| `#staff-vc-text` | Text | Optional: text companion for a future staff voice channel. |
| `#whimsey-ai-communicate` | Text | WHIMSEY AI operational log — AI posts actions here for Lyra's awareness. |
| `#message-confirmation` | Text | Pending public messages awaiting Lyra's approval before posting. |
| `#discord-updates` | Text | ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: private channel for Discord platform changelog and feature updates. Point Discord's "Community updates channel" setting here. |

### Category 10: `📋 | AUDITS` (granular real-time event log)

Every event in the server gets captured here in its OWN channel — nothing is buried under unrelated noise. Carl-bot is the primary log writer; Discord's native AutoMod, Vulcan, and Ticket Tool also feed their own. **Humans (including mods and you) should NEVER post here.** Logs must stay tamper-free for forensics.

#### User-action logs

| Channel | What gets logged | Source bot |
|---|---|---|
| `#audit-mod-actions` | Every kick, ban, timeout, unban, untimeout — by who, on who, with reason | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-messages` | Every edited message (before/after) and deleted message (full content + author) | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-joins-leaves` | Every join (with account-age stamp), every leave (with how-long-they-stayed) | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-role-changes` | Every role added or removed from a member, by who | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-nicknames` | Every nickname change | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-member-updates` | Username changes, avatar changes (impersonator detection) | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-voice` | VC joins, leaves, mutes, deafens, moves | Carl-bot |

#### Server-structure logs

| Channel | What gets logged | Source bot |
|---|---|---|
| `#audit-channels` | Channel created, renamed, edited, deleted; permission overwrite changes | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-roles` | Role created, renamed, recolored, deleted; role permission changes | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-server` | Server settings changes (name, region, AutoMod, vanity, icon, banner) | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-emoji-stickers` | Emoji / sticker / soundboard added, renamed, removed | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-threads-events` | Threads created/archived/deleted; scheduled events created/edited/cancelled | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-invites` | Every invite created (with creator + expiry), used (member-attribution), deleted | Carl-bot |
| `#audit-bots` | Bots, integrations, and webhooks added or removed | Carl-bot |

#### Safety logs

| Channel | What gets logged | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#audit-automod` | Every Discord native AutoMod hit (spam, slurs, mention spam) | Discord native AutoMod |
| `#audit-scam-watch` | Every Carl-bot scam-keyword or scam-link hit | Carl-bot |

#### Holder / collection logs

| Channel | What gets logged | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#audit-wallet-verifications` | Every Vulcan wallet-verify attempt (success / failure / wallet address) | Vulcan |
| `#audit-holder-changes` | Every `Holder 🌌` role grant or revoke | Carl-bot (mirrors Vulcan actions) |

#### Ticket + boost logs

| Channel | What gets logged | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#audit-tickets` | Every ticket opened/closed (one-line summary; full transcript still goes to `#ticket-logs`) | Ticket Tool |
| `#audit-boosts` | Every server boost added or removed (so you can thank the booster publicly) | Carl-bot |

#### Bot-specific log channels

| Channel | What gets logged | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#log-auth-bot` | Auth verification events — captcha passes, fails, kicks, re-verify attempts | Auth |
| `#log-vulcan` | Vulcan wallet/NFT events — wallet connects, verification passes, failures, role grants/revokes | Vulcan |
| `#log-ticket-tool` | Ticket Tool opens, closes, and transcript links | Ticket Tool |
| `#log-carlbot` | Carl-bot AutoMod hits and scheduled post confirmations | Carl-bot |

> **Total in AUDITS: 21 channels.** Yes, it's a lot — but each is dead-quiet 95% of the time and screams loud when something matters. This is exactly how big NFT servers (Pudgy, Doodles, Cool Cats) keep clean trails.

### Category 11: `📈 | MOMENTUM` (server + collection real-time pulse)

Dashboards and recurring stats — the heartbeat of WHIMSEY. All channels here are bot-written on a schedule, read-only for the team. This is what you check every morning to know how the community + collection are doing.

| Channel | What lives here | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#momentum-member-joins` | ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: Discord System Messages land here (private, not public). Set Discord's "System messages channel" to this. | Discord native (system messages) |
| `#momentum-daily-recap` | Every day at 23:55 IST: joins, leaves, messages, active members, top 3 channels, top 3 contributors, AutoMod hits, tickets opened/closed | Carl-bot scheduled embed |
| `#momentum-weekly-recap` | Sunday 23:55 IST: weekly version + week-over-week % change | Carl-bot scheduled embed |
| `#momentum-monthly-recap` | Last day of month, 23:55 IST: month-over-month rollup | Carl-bot scheduled embed |
| `#momentum-holder-snapshot` | Daily 00:05 IST: total Holder count, new today, lost today, % of 30,000 supply verified-on-Discord, top-10-wallet concentration | Mod runs Vulcan `/list-holders` (Carl-bot reminds at 00:00) |
| `#momentum-server-stats` | Live counts: total members, online now, Verified count, Holder count (auto-updated voice-channel-style or pinned embed) | Carl-bot custom command + manual refresh, or Statbot if you add it later |
| `#momentum-collection-feed` | Real-time on-chain sales, listings, transfers, mints of $CNDY (see section 32) | NFT Tracker bot (5th core bot) |
| `#momentum-twitter-feed` | Your official @WHIMSEY tweets auto-mirrored here for team awareness | Webhook (IFTTT / Zapier / Make.com) |
| `#momentum-team-pulse` | Weekly Monday 12:00 IST: top 3 message-count members + top 3 reaction-receivers, so the team can recognize them in `#announcements` | Carl-bot scheduled |

### Category 12: `🎫 | TICKETS`

| Channel | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `#ticket-logs` | Text | Ticket Tool posts the full transcript when a ticket is closed. |

> Each opened ticket becomes a temporary text channel inside this category automatically — Ticket Tool handles that. Don't create those manually.

All four new categories' permissions are configured in sections 24, 24A, 24B, and 25.

---

## ✅ DO — 11) BOT 1 — `Auth` (verification gateway)

**Invite order:** 1st (invite this BEFORE the others).

### What it does
A new joiner enters `#verify`, clicks the Auth button, completes a captcha. Auth then assigns the `Verified 🩵` role.

### Required permissions when inviting
On the bot's invite page, tick exactly these:

| Permission | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Manage Roles | ✅ | To assign `Verified 🩵`. |
| View Channels | ✅ | To see `#verify`. |
| Send Messages | ✅ | To post the verify panel. |
| Embed Links | ✅ | The panel is an embed. |
| Use External Emojis | ✅ | For the captcha visuals. |
| Add Reactions | ✅ | If using reaction-based verify. |
| Manage Messages | ✅ | To clean up bot replies in `#verify`. |
| Read Message History | ✅ | Standard. |
| Use Application Commands | ✅ | Slash commands. |

### Hierarchy slot
Drag `Auth` to position **#4** (above `Verified 🩵`, below `Carl-bot`).

### Configuration (in Auth's web dashboard)
- **Verification channel:** `#verify`
- **Role to grant on success:** `Verified 🩵`
- **Verification method:** Captcha + button (image captcha is the most bot-resistant).
- **Re-verification on rejoin:** ON (forces them to verify again if they leave and re-join).
- **Welcome DM (optional):** "Welcome to WHIMSEY! Read `#rules` first, then say hi in `#welcome`. The team will NEVER DM you first — anyone who does is a scammer."

---

## ✅ DO — 12) BOT 2 — `Vulcan` (NFT wallet verification)

**Invite order:** 2nd.

### What it does
A `Verified 🩵` member opens `#holder-verify`, clicks the Vulcan button, signs a wallet message (no funds moved, no gas), and if the wallet holds at least one $CNDY NFT, Vulcan assigns the `Holder 🌌` role.

### Required permissions when inviting

| Permission | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Manage Roles | ✅ | To assign `Holder 🌌`. |
| View Channels | ✅ | To see `#holder-verify`. |

| Embed Links | ✅ | Panel is an embed. |
| Manage Messages | ✅ | To clean up join messages. |
| Read Message History | ✅ | Standard. |
| Use Application Commands | ✅ | Slash commands. |

### Hierarchy slot
Drag `Vulcan` to position **#5** (above `Holder 🌌`, below `Auth`).

### Configuration (Vulcan "Command Center")
- **Add Token-Granted Role (TGR):**
  - Chain: (your collection's chain — Ethereum / Polygon / Solana)
  - Contract address: your $CNDY contract address
  - Minimum balance: **1**
  - Role granted: `Holder 🌌`
- **Verification channel:** `#holder-verify`
- **Re-verification interval:** **24 hours** (so wallets that sell lose Holder).
- **Force re-verify command:** keep enabled so mods can force a re-check.

---

## ✅ DO — 13) BOT 3 — `Ticket Tool`

**Invite order:** 3rd.

### What it does
A member clicks the Ticket Tool panel button in `#open-tickets`, picks a ticket category, and Ticket Tool spawns a private channel inside `🎫 | TICKETS` visible only to the member, the staff, and Ticket Tool. When closed, a transcript posts to `#ticket-logs`.

### Required permissions when inviting

| Permission | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Manage Channels | ✅ | To create per-ticket channels. |
| Manage Roles | ✅ | To set per-ticket permission overwrites. |
| View Channels | ✅ | Standard. |

| Embed Links | ✅ | Panel + transcripts are embeds. |
| Attach Files | ✅ | To upload transcript files. |
| Read Message History | ✅ | To build transcripts. |

### Hierarchy slot

- **Ticket category:** `🎫 | TICKETS` (the new category from section 10)
- **Support roles:** `Admin 💗` and `Moderator ☁️`
- **Transcript channel:** `#ticket-logs`
- **Auto-close inactive tickets after:** 48 hours
- **Ping support role on new ticket:** ON
- **Panel button categories:** create 4 buttons —
  1. **General Question** — for anything not covered elsewhere
  2. **Wallet / Holder Issue** — verification failed, wallet not detected
  3. **Scam Report** — to report a user who tried to scam them
  4. **Bug / Server Issue** — broken channels, stuck roles, etc.

---

## ✅ DO — 14) BOT 4 — `Carl-bot`

**Invite order:** 4th (invite LAST, after the others are working).

### What it does
This is your auto-team-member. Section 28 has the full operations playbook.

### Required permissions when inviting

| Permission | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Manage Roles | ✅ | Reaction-roles, optional self-roles. |
| Manage Channels | ✅ | Slowmode automation. |
| Manage Messages | ✅ | AutoMod deletions. |
| Manage Nicknames | ✅ | Anti-impersonator nickname filter. |
| Manage Webhooks | ✅ | For its log channels. |

### Hierarchy slot
Drag `Carl-bot` to position **#3** (just below `Moderator ☁️`, above the other bots).

### Configuration
See section 28 — full Carl-bot operations playbook.

---

## ✅ DO — 15) BOT ROLE POSITIONING — FINAL RECAP

After all 4 bots are invited and dragged, your role list (top → bottom) MUST look like:

```
1.   Admin 💗
2.   Moderator ☁️
3.   Carl-bot
4.   Auth
5.   Vulcan
6.   Ticket Tool
7.   Holder 🌌
8.   Verified 🩵
9.   @everyone
```

If any of these are out of order, the bots will silently fail to assign or remove roles. Double-check with **Server Settings → Roles**.

---

# PART B — CATEGORY-LEVEL PERMISSIONS

For every category below, do this:
1. Right-click the category → **Edit Category** → **Permissions** tab.
2. The orange banner ("Heads up, @everyone does not have permission to view…") is expected. Click **Advanced permissions** to expand the full list.
3. Click the **+** next to "ROLES/MEMBERS" to add each role mentioned in the table.
4. For each row, set the three-state toggle to: ❌ Deny / ➖ Neutral / ✅ Allow.
5. For permissions NOT mentioned in a table, leave them on ➖ Neutral. They will inherit from the role's server-wide setting.
6. After saving, when you click any channel inside the category, you should see "**Permissions synced with category**" — that means the channel inherits the category's settings. If it says "**Sync Now**", click it for channels you have NOT given per-channel overrides to (section 26 lists the channels that need overrides — leave those unsynced).

> Reminder of label changes at category vs role vs channel level:
> - "Send Messages and Create Posts" appears at category level
> - "Send Messages" appears at single-channel level
> - "Manage Threads and Posts" at category level vs "Manage Threads" at single-channel level
> - "View Channels" at category level vs "View Channel" at single-channel level

## ✅ DO — 16) CATEGORY 1 — `💗 | VERIFY`

**Visibility goal:** ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: ALWAYS VISIBLE to ALL members — including Verified 🩵 and Holder 🌌. Members must always be able to return to `#access-info` and `#verify`. Do NOT hide this category after verification.

This category gives `@everyone` Allow ✅ on `View Channels`. Do NOT give `Verified 🩵` or `Holder 🌌` Deny ❌ on View Channels here — the category must stay visible to everyone at all times.

## ✅ DO — 18) CATEGORY 3 — `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE`

**Visibility goal:** Same as `🌊 | START HERE` — read-only for the community, write for staff. This is your "lore + collection info" library.

Use the **EXACT SAME table as section 17**. Apply identically.

(The only practical difference is staff posts much less often here — but the permission shape is the same.)

---

## ✅ DO — 19) CATEGORY 4 — `📌 | COMMUNITY`

**Visibility goal:** Hidden from `@everyone`. Verified + Holder can chat freely. `#whimsey-of-the-day` is overridden to staff-write-only at the channel level (section 26).

## ✅ DO — 20) CATEGORY 5 — `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`

**Visibility goal:** This is the trickiest one. `@everyone` and `Verified 🩵` should NOT see this category by default — but `Verified 🩵` MUST be able to see ONE channel inside (`#holder-verify`) so they can claim Holder status. We achieve this by setting Verified to Deny ❌ on `View Channels` here at the category level, and then explicitly Allowing ✅ `View Channel` for Verified at the `#holder-verify` channel level (section 26).

## ✅ DO — 21) CATEGORY 6 — `🌷 | COLLECTORS`

**Visibility goal:** Hidden from `@everyone`. Open chat for Verified + Holder. `#trading-post` and `#market-talk` get a slowmode override at the channel level (section 26).

Use the **SAME table as section 19** (`📌 | COMMUNITY`). The behavior is identical.

---

## ✅ DO — 22) CATEGORY 7 — `🩵 | EVENTS`

**Visibility goal:** Hidden from `@everyone`. Verified + Holder can VIEW + REACT but NOT send messages (because giveaways and polls work via reactions/buttons, not chat).

## ✅ DO — 23) CATEGORY 8 — `☁️ | SUPPORT`

**Visibility goal:** Hidden from `@everyone`. Verified + Holder can read everything, can chat in `#support`, can react in `#faqs` and `#scam-alerts` (read-only), and can click the Ticket Tool button in `#open-tickets`.

This is where your `#support` vs `#open-tickets` clarification lives:
- `#support` = open public help. Verified + Holder + Mod + Admin can post.
- `#open-tickets` = entry to private 1-on-1 help. Verified + Holder cannot type, only click the bot button.

**Visibility goal:** Visible to ONLY `Admin 💗`, `Moderator ☁️`, `Carl-bot`, `Vulcan`, and `Ticket Tool`. Hidden from everyone else. **Critical:** even though humans can VIEW these channels, they must NOT be able to send messages here. Only bots write. This protects the audit trail from being tampered with (or accidentally polluted).

> **Why mods are denied Send Messages here even though they're trusted:** an audit trail is only useful if it's untouched. If a mod could delete a log entry, they could cover up a mistake (or worse, an abuse). Keep humans out. Use reactions (✅ "investigated", 👀 "watching", ⚠️ "needs follow-up") to mark entries instead of replying.

**Visibility goal:** Same as AUDITS — visible to team + log-writing bots. Humans CAN post manual annotations here (unlike AUDITS), because Momentum is a dashboard you discuss, not a forensic trail.

## ✅ DO — 25) CATEGORY 12 — `🎫 | TICKETS` (NEW PRIVATE)

**Visibility goal:** Visible to ONLY `Admin 💗`, `Moderator ☁️`, and `Ticket Tool`. Each opened ticket-channel inside this category will have ADDITIONAL per-channel overwrites added by Ticket Tool to also allow the user who opened the ticket — that's automatic, you don't configure it.

# PART C — PER-CHANNEL OVERRIDES

For every channel listed in this section, click the channel → Edit Channel → Permissions → Advanced permissions and apply the override(s) listed. Channels NOT listed here should be left as **Synced with category** (you'll see a "Permissions synced with category" banner — do not unsync them).

The exact permission labels at single-channel level are slightly shorter than at category level (e.g. "Send Messages" instead of "Send Messages and Create Posts", "Manage Threads" instead of "Manage Threads and Posts", "View Channel" singular instead of "View Channels" plural). I've used the channel-level labels below.

---

## ✅ DO — 26) PER-CHANNEL OVERRIDES

### 26.1) `#access-info` (in `💗 | VERIFY`)

This is the very first thing a new joiner sees. Read-only.

| Permission | @everyone | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Use Application Commands | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |

> Position this channel at the **top of the category** so it loads first when a new joiner arrives.

---

### 26.2) `#verify` (in `💗 | VERIFY`)

The Auth bot's button lives here. `@everyone` MUST be allowed to use application commands here only.

| Permission | @everyone | Auth bot | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Use Application Commands | ✅ Allow *(critical — so the Auth button works)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.3) `#welcome` (in `🌊 | START HERE`)

Read-only welcome channel. Inherits most settings from the category — you only need ONE override on `Admin 💗` for posting.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

> Pin a beautifully formatted welcome message here.

---

### 26.4) `#rules` (in `🌊 | START HERE`)

Read-only rules channel. Critical that nothing is editable.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny *(even mods don't post here — only Admin)* | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ✅ Allow *(let them ✅ react to acknowledge)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow *(mods can edit/delete obsolete pinned content)* | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.5) `#announcements` (in `🌊 | START HERE`)

This is an **Announcement Channel** (Discord channel type). Right-click → Edit Channel → toggle "Announcement Channel" ON. This lets followers from other servers cross-post your announcements.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.6) Every channel in `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE`

(`#about-whimsey`, `#whimsey-universe`, `#sneak-peeks`, `#roadmap`, `#official-links`)

These should all stay **Synced with category** — they inherit `🌊 | START HERE`'s read-only-for-community pattern (which is the same as section 18).

**Optional:** make `#official-links` an Announcement Channel too, so partner servers can mirror your verified-link list.

---

### 26.7) `#whimsey-of-the-day` (in `📌 | COMMUNITY`)

Staff posts the daily Whimsey here. Verified + Holder can react but not write.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages in Threads | ✅ Allow *(let them discuss the daily Whimsey inside threads)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Create Public Threads | ❌ Deny *(only staff opens the daily thread)* | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

> **Pro tip:** Convert this channel to a **Forum Channel** (Edit Channel → channel type). Each daily Whimsey becomes its own thread the community can discuss without flooding a chat channel.

---

### 26.8) `#suggestions` (in `📌 | COMMUNITY`)

Inherits the category. **Optional:** turn ON Slowmode 5 minutes via Edit Channel → Slowmode, so suggestions are thought-out.

---

### 26.9) `#holder-verify` (in `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`)

THE most important channel-level override in the whole document. This is the single channel where `Verified 🩵` must be able to see a HOLDERS ONLY channel, click the Vulcan button, but NOT chat.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Vulcan | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ✅ Allow *(critical — overrides the category-level Deny on Verified)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Use Application Commands | ✅ Allow *(critical — so the Vulcan button works)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.10) `#holder-chat` (in `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`)

Inherits the category — Verified is already Denied at category level, so the channel correctly stays hidden from them. No overrides needed.

But to be doubly safe, explicitly add:

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 |
|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.11) `#holder-announcements` (in `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`)

Holder-exclusive read-only announcement channel. Make this an **Announcement Channel** (Edit Channel → toggle "Announcement Channel" ON).

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow *(so mods can ping `@Holder`)* | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.12) `#trading-post` (in `🌷 | COLLECTORS`)

Inherits the category. **Mandatory:** Edit Channel → Slowmode → set to **30 seconds** to prevent pump-and-dump spam.

Optional pinned message:

> ⚠️ **Trade at your own risk.** WHIMSEY does not facilitate or guarantee any trades made in this channel. Always verify the buyer/seller and use a trusted escrow.

---

### 26.13) `#market-talk` (in `🌷 | COLLECTORS`)

Inherits the category. **Mandatory:** Slowmode → **10 seconds**.

---

### 26.14) `#show-your-whimsey` (in `🌷 | COLLECTORS`)

Inherits the category. Optionally convert to a **Forum Channel** so each "show your Whimsey" post becomes its own thread.

---

### 26.15) `#giveaways` (in `🩵 | EVENTS`)

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Carl-bot | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.17) `#support` (in `☁️ | SUPPORT`)

This is the open public help channel — Verified + Holder CAN write here. Override the category-level Deny.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ✅ Allow *(overrides category Deny)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

| Create Public Threads | ✅ Allow *(so each support question can have its own thread)* | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

> **Mandatory:** Set Slowmode → **30 seconds** so people compose proper questions instead of one-line spam.

> **Pro tip:** Convert this channel to a **Forum Channel**. Each new help request becomes a thread that can be marked "✅ Solved" with Discord's tags. Way more organized at scale.

---

### 26.18) `#faqs` (in `☁️ | SUPPORT`)

Read-only knowledge base. Only Admin posts; mods can edit.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Manage Messages | ❌ Deny | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow *(mods can edit/pin)* | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.19) `#scam-alerts` (in `☁️ | SUPPORT`)

Read-only scam-warning channel. This is also where Carl-bot can mirror its public-facing scam alerts (private logs go to `#scam-watch`).

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Carl-bot | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

---

### 26.20) `#open-tickets` (in `☁️ | SUPPORT`)

Entry point to private 1-on-1 help. Members can ONLY click the Ticket Tool button — they cannot type or react.

| Permission | Verified 🩵 | Holder 🌌 | Ticket Tool | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| View Channel | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

> Pin a Ticket Tool panel embed at the top: "Need private help? Click a category below: General Question | Wallet/Holder Issue | Scam Report | Bug/Server Issue."

---

### 26.21) `#staff-announcements` (in `🔒 | STAFF`)

Read-only for mods, write for Admin only.

| Permission | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |
| Add Reactions | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.22) Every channel inside `📋 | AUDITS`

All 17 audit channels stay **Synced with category** — they inherit section 24A's table exactly. Mods read, react, but cannot post; only the source bot for that channel writes.

The category-level table in section 24A is sufficient for **all** channels in this category. The only optional per-channel tweak: for the bot that "owns" each audit channel, you can additionally allow that specific bot to manage messages there (e.g. Vulcan on `#audit-wallet-verifications`, Ticket Tool on `#audit-tickets`). This is already covered in section 24A.

> ⚠️ **Critical reminder:** even YOU as Admin should resist posting in audit channels. Use reactions to mark entries instead. The integrity of the trail is more valuable than any one comment.

#### 26.22a) `#audit-wallet-verifications` and `#audit-holder-changes` (additional Vulcan binding)

Make sure Vulcan has explicit Allow for these two:

| Permission | Vulcan |
|---|---|
| Send Messages | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ✅ Allow |

#### 26.22b) `#audit-tickets` (additional Ticket Tool binding)

| Permission | Ticket Tool |
|---|---|
| Send Messages | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ✅ Allow |

#### 26.22c) `#audit-automod` (Discord native AutoMod target)

In **Server Settings → AutoMod → each rule** → set "Send alert message to channel" → `#audit-automod`. No per-channel override needed; native AutoMod posts as Discord itself, which always has access.

---

### 26.23) `#mod-commands` (in `🔒 | STAFF`)

Free-for-all bot-command playground for the team.

| Permission | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 | Carl-bot | Auth | Vulcan | Ticket Tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Use Application Commands | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Manage Messages | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ➖ | ➖ | ➖ |

---

### 26.24) `#ticket-logs` (in `🎫 | TICKETS`)

Ticket Tool dumps closed-ticket transcripts here.

| Permission | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 | Ticket Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send Messages | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Attach Files | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow | ✅ Allow |

---

### 26.25) Every channel inside `📈 | MOMENTUM`

All channels stay **Synced with category** — they inherit section 24B's table. The team CAN post comments on a recap (unlike AUDITS) so threads can grow under each daily/weekly report.

Two channels need a small extra binding:

#### 26.25a) `#momentum-twitter-feed` (webhook target)

When you set up the IFTTT/Zapier/Make webhook that posts your @WHIMSEY tweets here, Discord generates a webhook URL. The webhook itself bypasses role permissions — you just need the webhook to exist on this channel. No per-role override needed.

| Permission | Moderator ☁️ | Admin 💗 |
|---|---|---|
| Manage Webhooks | ❌ Deny | ✅ Allow *(only Admin manages webhooks for security)* |

#### 26.25b) `#momentum-collection-feed` (NFT Tracker bot — see section 32)

The 5th core bot writes here. Give it explicit channel-level allow:

| Permission | NFT Tracker |
|---|---|
| View Channel | ✅ Allow |
| Send Messages | ✅ Allow |
| Embed Links | ✅ Allow |
| Attach Files | ✅ Allow |
| Read Message History | ✅ Allow |
| Use External Emojis | ✅ Allow |

---

## ✅ DO — 27) VERIFICATION FLOW — EXACT BOT PANEL CONTENT

### `#access-info` pinned message (you post this manually as Admin)

> 💗 **Welcome to WHIMSEY**
> 
> To unlock the rest of the server:
> 1. Head to `#verify` (right below this channel).
> 2. Click the **Verify** button on the Auth panel.
> 3. Complete the captcha.
> 4. You'll instantly receive the **Verified 🩵** role and the rest of the server will appear.
> 
> ⚠️ **Important safety note:** the WHIMSEY team will NEVER DM you first. Anyone DMing you offering a mint, an airdrop, or "support" is a scammer. Report them in `#scam-alerts` after you verify.

### `#verify` — Auth bot panel

Auth bot will post this automatically once you configure the verification channel in its dashboard.

### `#holder-verify` — pinned message (post manually) + Vulcan panel

Pinned manual message:

> 🌌 **Holder Verification**
> 
> Own a WHIMSEY ($CNDY) NFT? Verify your wallet below to unlock the exclusive `#holder-chat` and `#holder-announcements` channels.
> 
> 1. Click the **Connect Wallet** button on the Vulcan panel.
> 2. Sign the message in your wallet (no funds will move, no gas required).
> 3. Vulcan will check the WHIMSEY contract for your wallet's balance.
> 4. If you hold ≥ 1 $CNDY NFT, you'll receive the **Holder 🌌** role and the holder channels will appear.
> 
> Re-verification happens every 24 hours. If you sell your NFT, the role is automatically removed.

Vulcan's panel posts automatically once you finish the Command Center setup.

### `#open-tickets` — Ticket Tool panel embed

Configure Ticket Tool to post:

> 🎫 **Open a Private Ticket**
> 
> For sensitive or 1-on-1 help, open a ticket below. Only you and the WHIMSEY team will see it.
> 
> [General Question] [Wallet / Holder Issue] [Scam Report] [Bug / Server Issue]

---

## ✅ DO — 28) THE CARL-BOT OPERATIONS PLAYBOOK

This is the full configuration for Carl-bot — the brain of your server. It does the work of 4 mods at the same time, 24/7. Configure everything below in the Carl-bot dashboard at **carl.gg → Dashboard → [WHIMSEY server]**.

### 28.1) AutoMod rules (replaces a 24/7 mod)

In Carl-bot dashboard → **AutoMod** → enable each:

- **Anti-invite filter:** auto-delete any non-WHIMSEY Discord invite link in any public channel.
  - Whitelist: your own server's invite.
  - 1st violation: delete + warn in `#audit-scam-watch`. 3rd violation: 1-hour timeout.
- **Anti-link filter:** in `#general-chat`, `#whimsey-talk`, `#fan-creations`, `#suggestions`, `#show-your-whimsey`, `#trading-post`, `#market-talk`, `#support`, auto-delete suspicious crypto/scam links.
  - Whitelist: your official site, OpenSea/Magic Eden listing URL, your verified Twitter, your Linktree.
- **Anti-spam filter:** 5+ messages in 3 seconds → 10-minute timeout + log.
- **Anti-mention-spam filter:** more than 5 mentions in one message → delete + 30-minute timeout.
- **Anti-caps filter:** message with >70% caps → auto-delete (warning only, no timeout).
- **Banned-words filter:** paste your scam keyword list (section 3.6). Action: delete + post alert in `#audit-scam-watch`.
- **NSFW image filter:** Discord's classifier; confidence > 80% → delete + 24-hour timeout.
- **Anti-zalgo / unicode-spam filter:** filter messages with excessive combining characters → delete.
- **Anti-newline-spam filter:** messages with > 8 newlines → delete.

### 28.2) Real-time logging — bind EVERY event to its dedicated audit channel

This is the core of your "track everything" architecture. Carl-bot can log 30+ distinct event types. In **Carl-bot dashboard → Logging**, enable each event with the corresponding destination channel.

#### User-action log bindings

| Carl-bot event | Destination channel |
|---|---|
| Member kick | `#audit-mod-actions` |
| Member ban | `#audit-mod-actions` |
| Member unban | `#audit-mod-actions` |

| Bot/integration removed | `#audit-bots` |
| Webhook created / edited / deleted | `#audit-bots` |

#### Safety log bindings

| Event | Destination |
|---|---|
| Carl-bot AutoMod hit (anti-invite, anti-spam, anti-caps, anti-mention-spam, banned-words, NSFW image) | `#audit-scam-watch` |
| Discord native AutoMod hit (configure in Server Settings → AutoMod → each rule's "Send alert" → set channel) | `#audit-automod` |

#### Holder / boost log bindings

| Event | Destination |
|---|---|
| `Holder 🌌` role added (Carl-bot detects role-add events) | `#audit-holder-changes` *(mirrors Vulcan's grant for easy auditing in one place)* |
| `Holder 🌌` role removed | `#audit-holder-changes` |
| `Verified 🩵` role added | `#audit-holder-changes` *(optional, gives a single feed of "membership state changes")* |
| Server boost added | `#audit-boosts` *(post a celebration message — boosters love being recognized)* |
| Server boost removed | `#audit-boosts` |

> **Note on Vulcan's wallet-verification logs:** Vulcan posts its own log to `#audit-wallet-verifications`. In Vulcan's Command Center → Logs → set the destination channel. This is separate from Carl-bot.

> **Note on Ticket Tool's ticket logs:** Ticket Tool posts a one-line summary to `#audit-tickets` (ticket opened by X, ticket closed by Y after Z minutes) and the FULL transcript to `#ticket-logs` inside `🎫 | TICKETS`. Set both in Ticket Tool's dashboard → Logging.

### 28.3) Reaction roles (optional self-assigned roles)

Create a new channel `#roles` inside `🌊 | START HERE` (read-only for community, like `#rules`). Pin a Carl-bot reaction-role panel:

> Pick the pings you want:
> 🔔 — Announcement Pings (you'll be pinged for `#announcements`)
> 🎉 — Giveaway Pings (you'll be pinged when a giveaway opens)
> 🗳️ — Poll Pings
> 🧑‍🎨 — Fan Artist (you'll be pinged when we do art calls)
> 🛒 — Trader Pings (you'll be pinged for trading-post heat / floor moves)

This way you don't need to `@everyone` for non-critical updates.

### 28.4) Auto-responses

Set Carl-bot triggers in **Dashboard → Tags / Auto-Responder**:

- Trigger: "how do I verify", "how to verify", "where do i verify"
  → Reply: "Head to `#access-info`, then click Verify in `#verify` 💗"
- Trigger: "is this a scam", "is this real", "got a dm"
  → Reply: "Read `#scam-alerts` — and remember: the team will NEVER DM you first."
- Trigger: "when mint", "wen mint", "when launch"
  → Reply: "Mint info is always live in `#roadmap` and `#announcements`."
- Trigger: "how do I become a holder", "holder role"
  → Reply: "Head to `#holder-verify` and click the Vulcan button to verify your wallet 🌌"
- Trigger: "support", "i need help"
  → Reply: "Ask publicly in `#support`. For private help (wallet/scam/sensitive issues), open a ticket in `#open-tickets` 🎫"

### 28.5) Scheduled "momentum" reports — the heart of real-time tracking

Carl-bot's scheduled-message system can post recurring summaries. Set these up in **Dashboard → Scheduled Messages**:

#### Daily server recap → `#momentum-daily-recap` at 23:55 IST

Use a Carl-bot scheduled embed with the following template (Carl-bot fills the placeholders):

```
📊 WHIMSEY Daily Recap — {date}

🆕 Joins today: {joins_today}
👋 Leaves today: {leaves_today}
📈 Net growth: {net_growth_today}
💬 Messages today: {messages_today}
🟢 Active members today: {active_members_today}
🔝 Top 3 channels: {top_channels_today}
🏆 Top 3 contributors: {top_contributors_today}
🌌 New Holders today: {new_holders_today}
😢 Lost Holders today: {lost_holders_today}
🛡️ AutoMod hits today: {automod_hits_today}
🎫 Tickets opened: {tickets_opened_today}
🎫 Tickets closed: {tickets_closed_today}
```

> If Carl-bot's free tier doesn't support every placeholder, the team can run a slash command at end of day to generate the recap manually. Either way, this channel becomes your daily heartbeat.

#### Weekly server recap → `#momentum-weekly-recap` at Sunday 23:55 IST

Same structure as daily, but for the past 7 days, with week-over-week comparison (e.g. "+12% messages vs last week", "+47 net members vs last week"). Pin the most recent 4 weeks for at-a-glance trend.

#### Monthly server recap → `#momentum-monthly-recap` on the last day of the month at 23:55 IST

Month-over-month rollup. This is what you'd share with potential partners ("WHIMSEY did 12,000 messages and gained 380 net members in November").

#### Daily holder snapshot → `#momentum-holder-snapshot` at 00:05 IST

Carl-bot posts a reminder at 00:00 IST to `#staff-chat`: "📸 Holder snapshot time — run `/list-holders` in `#mod-commands` and post in `#momentum-holder-snapshot`."

The snapshot should track:
- Total `Holder 🌌` count (verified-on-Discord)
- New Holders since yesterday
- Holders lost since yesterday
- % of 30,000 supply that is verified-on-Discord (verified holders / 30,000 × 100)
- Top-10-wallet concentration (% of supply held by top 10 wallets — concentration risk indicator)

#### Live server stats pinboard → `#momentum-server-stats`

Pin a Carl-bot embed that the team manually refreshes weekly via slash command:
- Total members
- Verified members
- Holders
- Boost level + boost count
- Online now (refresh-on-demand)

#### Weekly community contributor recognition → `#momentum-team-pulse` at Monday 12:00 IST

Carl-bot scheduled embed: top 3 message-count members + top 3 reaction-receivers + top 3 forum/thread starters from the past week. Use this to pick a "Whimsey of the Week" hero to spotlight in `#announcements`.

#### Daily safety reminder → `#general-chat` at 12:00 IST every day

Rotating tip-of-the-day:
- Mon: "🩵 Reminder: never share your seed phrase. The team will NEVER DM you first."
- Tue: "🌌 Holders — re-verify in `#holder-verify` if your role goes missing after a wallet move."
- Wed: "🚨 Suspicious DM? Screenshot it and report in `#scam-alerts`."
- Thu: "✨ Forgot how to verify? Head to `#access-info`."
- Fri: "🎉 Got fan art? Drop it in `#fan-creations` or `#show-your-whimsey`."
- Sat: "🗳️ Vote on community polls in `#polls`."
- Sun: "📊 Weekly recap is up in `#momentum-weekly-recap` (staff only)."

#### Daily nudge to staff → `#whimsey-of-the-day` at 14:00 IST

"📌 Time for today's Whimsey of the Day! Pick one and post."

### 28.6) Auto-slowmode

Carl-bot can auto-enable slowmode if a channel hits >30 messages/minute. Enable on:
- `#general-chat`
- `#whimsey-talk`
- `#trading-post`
- `#support`

### 28.7) Anti-impersonator nickname filter

Add a Carl-bot custom rule: if any non-staff member sets their nickname to contain "Admin", "Mod", "Moderator", "WHIMSEY Support", "WHIMSEY Team", "Support", "Team", "Official", "Founder" — auto-revert their nickname and time them out for 1 hour. Log to `#audit-mod-actions` AND `#audit-nicknames`.

### 28.8) Welcome system

- Send a DM to new joiners: "Welcome to WHIMSEY! Read `#access-info` and verify in `#verify` to unlock the server. The team will NEVER DM you first."
- Post a welcome card in `#welcome` AFTER they verify (Carl-bot triggered by `Verified 🩵` role-add).
- Account-age check on join: if account is < 24 hours old, auto-flag in `#audit-joins-leaves` with ⚠️ emoji so mods can watch.

### 28.9) Carl-bot permission overrides it needs to make logging work

For Carl-bot to write into every audit + momentum channel, give Carl-bot's role at the **category** level for both `📋 | AUDITS` and `📈 | MOMENTUM`:

- View Channels ✅ Allow
- Send Messages and Create Posts ✅ Allow
- Embed Links ✅ Allow
- Attach Files ✅ Allow
- Read Message History ✅ Allow
- Manage Messages ✅ Allow (so it can clean up its own old logs if needed)
- Use External Emojis ✅ Allow
- Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles ✅ Allow (so it can `@Moderator` on critical events like mass-ban detection)

These are already in the section 24A and 24B tables — just verify after invite that nothing got dropped.

### 28.10) Optional but powerful: Carl-bot tag commands for the team

Use Carl-bot tags to give your team one-letter shortcuts:

- `?tag rules` → posts the rules summary
- `?tag scam` → posts the scam-warning template
- `?tag verify` → posts the verify instructions
- `?tag holder` → posts the holder-verify instructions
- `?tag stats` → posts a live stats summary
- `?tag snapshot` → posts the latest holder snapshot pulled from `#momentum-holder-snapshot`

Saves the team typing the same answers 50 times a day.

## ✅ DO — 29) PRE-LAUNCH TEST CHECKLIST

Use a SECOND Discord account (not yours, not a mod's) and walk through this. Tick every box. Anything that fails — fix before launching.

### Unverified joiner test

- [ ] Joining the server, the membership-screening rules appear and require accept.
- [ ] On entering, ONLY the `💗 | VERIFY` category is visible.
- [ ] `#access-info` is the very first channel in the channel list.
- [ ] I cannot send messages in `#access-info` or `#verify`.
- [ ] I CAN see Auth bot's panel in `#verify`.
- [ ] Clicking the Verify button shows me a captcha.
- [ ] On success, I receive the `Verified 🩵` role.
- [ ] ⚠️ TEAM EXCEPTION: The `💗 | VERIFY` category remains visible (it should NOT disappear — this is intentional per team spec).
- [ ] All public categories also appear in this order: START HERE → THE UNIVERSE → COMMUNITY → HOLDERS ONLY → COLLECTORS → EVENTS → SUPPORT.

### Verified 🩵 test

- [ ] In `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY` I see ONLY `#holder-verify`. I CANNOT see `#holder-chat` or `#holder-announcements`.
- [ ] I CANNOT send messages in: `#welcome`, `#rules`, `#announcements`, every channel in `❄️ | THE UNIVERSE`, `#whimsey-of-the-day`, `#holder-verify`, `#holder-announcements`, `#whimsey-of-the-day`, `#giveaways`, `#polls`, `#faqs`, `#scam-alerts`, `#open-tickets`.
- [ ] I CAN send messages in: `#general-chat`, `#whimsey-talk`, `#fan-creations`, `#suggestions`, `#show-your-whimsey`, `#trading-post` (with 30s slowmode), `#market-talk` (with 10s slowmode), `#support`.
- [ ] I CAN react in every channel I can see (read-only ones included).
- [ ] I CANNOT see `🔒 | STAFF` or `🎫 | TICKETS`.
- [ ] I CAN see Vulcan's panel in `#holder-verify`.
- [ ] I CAN see Ticket Tool's panel in `#open-tickets` and the button works.
- [ ] Clicking Ticket Tool's button creates a private channel inside `🎫 | TICKETS`. I can see it; mods can see it; other Verified users CANNOT see it.
- [ ] Closing the ticket archives it and posts a transcript in `#ticket-logs`.
- [ ] Trying to type `@everyone` or `@here` in `#general-chat` does NOT ping anyone.
- [ ] Trying to ping `@Moderator` in `#general-chat` does NOT ping anyone.

### Holder 🌌 test (use a wallet that holds a $CNDY NFT, OR temporarily set Vulcan minimum to 0 for testing — restore to 1 after)

- [ ] After Vulcan confirms, I receive `Holder 🌌`.
- [ ] `#holder-chat` and `#holder-announcements` appear.
- [ ] I CAN send in `#holder-chat`.
- [ ] I CANNOT send in `#holder-announcements` but I CAN react.

### Sale-loss test

- [ ] Move the $CNDY NFT out of the wallet. Force a Vulcan re-verify. Verify that `Holder 🌌` is removed and the holder channels disappear.

### Moderator test

- [ ] Mod sees everything Verified + Holder sees, plus `🔒 | STAFF` and `🎫 | TICKETS`.
- [ ] Mod can delete a message in `#general-chat`.
- [ ] Mod can time out a user.
- [ ] Mod CANNOT kick the Admin (because Admin sits above Mod in the hierarchy).
- [ ] Mod CANNOT delete a channel.
- [ ] Mod CANNOT change `@everyone` permissions.

### Bot tests

- [ ] Auth posts the verification panel in `#verify`.
- [ ] Vulcan posts the wallet panel in `#holder-verify`.
- [ ] Ticket Tool posts the ticket panel in `#open-tickets`.
- [ ] Carl-bot logs an edit/delete in `#message-logs`.
- [ ] Carl-bot logs a kick in `#mod-logs`.
- [ ] Carl-bot logs a join/leave in `#join-leave-logs`.
- [ ] Pasting a fake Discord invite in `#general-chat` → auto-deleted by Carl-bot, alert appears in `#scam-watch`.
- [ ] Pasting "free mint claim now" → auto-deleted.
- [ ] Reacting to the role-picker panel in `#roles` adds/removes the optional ping role correctly.

### Leak / sneak test (the most important section)

- [ ] As Verified (no Holder), copy a message link from `#holder-chat` (have a Holder give you the link) and paste it in your browser → Discord should refuse access ("Channel not found" or no preview).
- [ ] As `@everyone` (logged out / brand-new throwaway), I see ONLY VERIFY.
- [ ] As Verified, opening any channel in `🔒 | STAFF` via direct URL fails.
- [ ] No bot has Administrator. Confirm in **Server Settings → Roles**.
- [ ] No human role except Admin has Administrator.
- [ ] Server requires 2FA for moderation actions (test by trying a mod action from an account that has 2FA disabled — should fail).

## ✅ DO — 30) POLISH TASKS FOR A 30,000-SUPPLY LAUNCH

These separate Doodles/Cool Cats/Pudgy-tier servers from generic NFT servers. Do as many as you can before public launch.

1. **Server icon, splash, banner.** Splash + banner need Boost Level 1 / 2.
2. **Server invite splash image** (the preview image people see on the invite link before they accept).
3. **Vanity URL** `discord.gg/whimsey` (Boost Level 3 — needs 14 boosts).
4. **Custom emoji + stickers** — upload 30–50 WHIMSEY-themed reactions. This becomes your community's "language".
5. **Custom soundboard sounds** — 8 short signature sounds for hype moments (Boost Level 2 / 3).
6. **Onboarding** with interest tags — see section 3.5.
7. **Native Discord Events** — pre-schedule mints, AMAs, giveaways using **Server → Events** so members can RSVP and get reminders.
8. **Apply for Server Discovery** once you have ≥1000 members and Onboarding set up — major organic growth lever.
9. **Apply for the Verified Server checkmark** once eligible — huge trust signal.
10. **Stage channel for AMAs** — town-hall style, Mods can mute speakers.
11. **Pinned messages** in every chat channel:
    - `#general-chat`: "🩵 Reminder: team will NEVER DM you. Read the rules in `#rules`."
    - `#trading-post`: trade-at-your-own-risk disclaimer.
    - `#holder-chat`: holder code-of-conduct.
12. **Rules embed** in `#rules` — use Carl-bot's `?embed` command for a beautiful, branded format instead of plain text.
13. **Anti-impersonator nickname filter** — section 28.7.
14. **Server template backup** — Server Settings → Server Template → create a template after setup. If the server is ever nuked, you can rebuild structure in one click.
15. **Document backup** — keep this markdown file and a screenshot of every role's permission tab in a secure folder.
16. **Weekly audit log review** — every Sunday, scroll **Server Settings → Audit Log** for the past week and look for anomalies.
17. **"We will NEVER DM you first" pin** — every public channel. This is the #1 scam vector.
18. **Holder snapshots** — when you do whitelist drops or airdrops, take a holder snapshot via Vulcan's `/list-holders` command or a third-party tool like Hashlist.
19. **Personal-Discord-settings guide** in `#scam-alerts` — show holders how to disable DMs from server members in their User Settings → Privacy & Safety.
20. **Two distinct Mod accounts for you** — keep an Admin account that is rarely online (high security, hardware key) and a Mod-level "daily driver" account. If your daily driver gets compromised, the server survives.
21. **Bot token rotation reminder** — every 6 months, rotate Auth and Vulcan's API keys. Compromised bot tokens are how most NFT servers get drained.
22. **Pre-mint dry-run** — 48 hours before mint, force-close the server (lock public channels via a panic-button command) and walk through the join → verify → holder flow with 5 outside testers.
23. **Mint-day plan** — pre-write your mint announcement, prepare your Twitter, prepare your `@everyone` ping, prepare a "we are aware of [X]" template for incidents, and have at least 2 mods online for the entire mint window.
24. **Post-mint audit** — within 24 hours of mint, run the leak test (section 29) again with a fresh holder.

## 📚 REFERENCE — 31) PERMISSION GLOSSARY (PLAIN ENGLISH)

Quick lookup for every permission used above, exactly as Discord names it.

## 📖 READ — ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

Lock everything down for `@everyone`. The only category they can see is `💗 | VERIFY`. Once they verify with the Auth bot, they get `Verified 🩵` and the rest of the public server appears. If they prove they own a $CNDY NFT via Vulcan in `#holder-verify`, they get `Holder 🌌` and the exclusive `#holder-chat` + `#holder-announcements` appear. The team has `Moderator ☁️` (everything except Administrator). You have `Admin 💗` (Administrator). The 4 bots — Auth (verify), Vulcan (wallet check), Ticket Tool (private support), Carl-bot (24/7 mod automation + logs) — sit between Mod and Holder in the hierarchy. Two new private categories `🔒 | STAFF` and `🎫 | TICKETS` exist for the team's eyes only. `#support` is open public help; `#open-tickets` is the door to private 1-on-1 help. Before launching, run section 29's checklist with a second account.

You're ready to launch WHIMSEY. 💗

## ✅ DO — 32) THE 5TH CORE BOT — NFT TRACKER (ON-CHAIN COLLECTION FEED) 📡

**Status: CONFIRMED CORE BOT.** This is now part of the standard 5-bot stack. Without it, `#momentum-collection-feed` is empty and you're blind to everything happening on-chain. With it, every $CNDY sale, listing, transfer, and mint posts automatically in real time.

### 32.1) What it does (and what it doesn't)

**It does:**
- Watches the $CNDY contract address on the blockchain 24/7
- Posts every sale, listing, de-listing, transfer, and mint as an embed in `#momentum-collection-feed`
- Includes price, buyer/seller wallet (with Etherscan/Solscan link), marketplace, and current floor at time of event
- Updates within seconds of the on-chain transaction confirming

**It doesn't:**
- Read any Discord messages
- DM any members
- Touch wallets — it only READS the blockchain
- Have any slash commands users can spam
- Overlap with any other bot

It is a single-purpose, write-only appliance. Lowest possible attack surface. Highest possible signal value.

### 32.2) Pick the right bot for your chain

| If $CNDY is on… | Use | Site |
|---|---|---|
| **Ethereum / Polygon** | **NFTSalesBot** (the most popular, best uptime) | `nftsalesbot.com` |
| **Solana** | **Hashlist** (Solana-native, best feature set) | `hashlist.com` |
| **OpenSea exclusive** | **OpenSea Sales Bot / Sweep Bot** (simplest, sales-only) | search "OpenSea Sales Bot Discord" |

> **You must confirm which chain $CNDY lives on before this step.** The doc assumes Ethereum/Polygon → NFTSalesBot by default. If Solana → swap every "NFTSalesBot" mention for "Hashlist" — the click-by-click flow below is identical.

### 32.3) Click-by-click setup (using NFTSalesBot as the example)

#### Step 1: Invite the bot

1. Go to **nftsalesbot.com**.
2. Click **"Add to Discord"** → log in with your Admin Discord account.
3. Select **WHIMSEY** server from the dropdown.
4. On the OAuth permission screen, grant ONLY these (uncheck everything else):
   - ✅ View Channels
   - ✅ Send Messages
   - ✅ Embed Links
   - ✅ Attach Files
   - ✅ Read Message History
   - ✅ Use External Emojis
   - ❌ Manage Roles (NEVER)
   - ❌ Manage Channels (NEVER)
   - ❌ Manage Server (NEVER)
   - ❌ Manage Webhooks (NEVER)
   - ❌ Mention Everyone (NEVER)
5. Click **Authorize** → complete the captcha.

#### Step 2: Set up the bot's role

1. Go to **Server Settings → Roles**.
2. The bot creates its own auto-role called **`NFT Tracker`** (or similar — rename if needed).
3. Set its color to a soft on-chain feel — e.g. `#9B59B6` (a calm purple to match the galaxy theme of `🌌 | HOLDERS ONLY`).
4. Open the role's permissions tab and **uncheck EVERY server-wide permission**. The bot will get exactly what it needs at the channel level only — no global permissions whatsoever. This is critical for security.
5. Move the `NFT Tracker` role in the role list to position **#6** (under Ticket Tool, above Holder 🌌). The full new role hierarchy:
   ```
   0. Admin 💗
   1. Moderator ☁️
   2. Carl-bot
   3. Auth
   4. Vulcan
   5. Ticket Tool
   6. NFT Tracker  ← here
   7. Holder 🌌
   8. Verified 🩵
   9. @everyone
   ```

#### Step 3: Bind it to `#momentum-collection-feed`

1. Open `#momentum-collection-feed` → ⚙️ **Edit Channel → Permissions → Advanced Permissions**.
2. Click **+** → search and select the `NFT Tracker` role.
3. Set these per-channel overrides:
   - View Channel ✅ Allow
   - Send Messages ✅ Allow
   - Embed Links ✅ Allow
   - Attach Files ✅ Allow
   - Read Message History ✅ Allow
   - Use External Emojis ✅ Allow
   - All other rows → leave Neutral ➖

This is the ONLY channel the bot can write to. Anywhere else in the server, it has zero access.

#### Step 4: Configure the watch on the bot's dashboard

1. Most NFT tracker bots use a slash command in your server to configure them. Run this in `#mod-commands`:
   ```
   /track add
   contract: 0xYourContractAddressHere
   channel: #momentum-collection-feed
   events: sales, listings, delistings, transfers, mints
   min_price: none
   marketplace: all
   currency: ETH
   currency_secondary: INR
   ```
2. If the bot has a web dashboard instead (NFTSalesBot does), log in there:
   - Server: **WHIMSEY**
   - Collection: **WHIMSEY ($CNDY)**
   - Contract address: `0xYourContractAddressHere`
   - Output channel: `#momentum-collection-feed`
   - Events to track: ✅ Sales ✅ Listings ✅ De-listings ✅ Transfers ✅ Mints
   - Minimum sale price filter: **none** (you want everything — a 30k supply will move a lot)
   - Currency display: **ETH (primary), INR (secondary)** so Indian community sees familiar prices
   - Embed style: **Rich embed with image** (always show the NFT artwork in the post)
   - Marketplace coverage: ✅ OpenSea ✅ Magic Eden ✅ Blur ✅ LooksRare ✅ X2Y2 (tick every marketplace)

#### Step 5: Test it before launch

1. Have a friend (or yourself, if you have a second wallet) buy 1 $CNDY on the open marketplace.
2. Within ~30 seconds of the transaction confirming on-chain, an embed should auto-post in `#momentum-collection-feed`.
3. If it doesn't post in 60 seconds, check `#audit-bots` to confirm the bot is online. If offline, see Crisis Scenario 33.9.
4. Once you see your first auto-posted sale embed → you're live. 💗

### 32.4) What you'll see (sample embeds)

Every event posts as a clean embed. Examples:

> 🛒 **WHIMSEY #4218 SOLD**
> Price: **0.32 ETH** (~₹68,000)
> Buyer: [`0x9ab…3f1`](https://etherscan.io)
> Seller: [`0x7c2…9de`](https://etherscan.io)
> Marketplace: **OpenSea**
> Floor at sale: 0.29 ETH
> [View on OpenSea ↗]

> 🏷️ **WHIMSEY #11042 LISTED**
> Price: **0.45 ETH** (~₹95,000) — 55% above floor

### 32.5) Combined with the rest of the stack — the 360° view

This bot completes the picture. Now you can see in one server:

- **What's happening on Discord:** Carl-bot's 20 audit channels
- **What's happening with members:** `#audit-joins-leaves`, `#audit-role-changes`, `#audit-holder-changes`
- **What's happening with the team:** `#audit-mod-actions`, `#audit-tickets`
- **What's happening on the blockchain:** `#momentum-collection-feed` (this bot)
- **What's happening in the macro:** `#momentum-daily-recap`, `#momentum-weekly-recap`, `#momentum-holder-snapshot`

A holder sells → the bot posts the sale → Vulcan sees the wallet is empty 4 hours later → posts the role-revoke in `#audit-holder-changes` → the daily snapshot reflects -1 holder → Carl-bot's daily recap shows the net change. **Every event has a paper trail.** That's true 360°.

### 32.6) Future expansion (don't do this on day 1)

Once the team is comfortable, you can:

- **Make `#momentum-collection-feed` visible to Holders.** Right now it's staff-only. Opening it to `Holder 🌌` creates social proof — holders love seeing their collection trade live. Caveat: this can also amplify floor-anxiety if there's a bad sales week, so wait until you have steady momentum before doing this.
- **Add per-event filters.** Some bots let you create a separate `#momentum-whale-feed` for sales > 1 ETH, or `#momentum-mint-feed` for the final 100 mints during a sellout. These can come later.
- **Add a price-tracking sidekick.** Bots like `NFT Floor Price` post hourly floor updates. Useful but optional — the sales feed alone gives you 90% of the signal.

## 📚 REFERENCE — 33) THE WHIMSEY CRISIS PLAYBOOK — EVERY DISASTER, EVERY FIX

This is the single most important section for the team. Pin this section's summary in `#staff-chat` and `#staff-announcements`. When something goes wrong, panic kills servers. A playbook saves them.

Every scenario below follows the same structure: **what's happening → first 60 seconds → next 5 minutes → next hour → post-mortem.** No improvisation. Just execute.

---

### 33.0) THE ONE-PAGE EMERGENCY SUMMARY (pin this)

> 🚨 **WHIMSEY CRISIS QUICK CARD**
>
> **Step 1 (always first):** Post in `#staff-chat` — "🚨 INCIDENT: [type] — handling, do not act independently."
> **Step 2:** Identify the playbook below (33.1 – 33.20).
> **Step 3:** Execute the 60-second action.
> **Step 4:** Screenshot everything to `#audit-mod-actions`.
> **Step 5:** When stable, post a public update in `#announcements`.
>
> **Hard rules during ANY crisis:**
> - 🩵 NEVER DM members "from the team" — even to help. Always reply in-channel.
> - 💗 Only Admin can ban; mods can timeout up to 24h.
> - ☁️ Mods do NOT delete audit logs, ever.
> - 🌌 If unsure, default to LOCKDOWN, not action. You can always unlock later.
> - 🚫 Never share screenshots of incidents publicly until 24h have passed.
>
> **Emergency lockdown command (have this ready):**
> Carl-bot: `?lockdown #channel-name` — locks the channel for `@everyone`. `?unlock #channel-name` to reverse.
> Server-wide lockdown: change `@everyone` Send Messages to ❌ Deny at the **server level** (Server Settings → Roles → @everyone).

---

### 33.1) Scenario: A scammer posts a fake mint link in `#general-chat`

**What's happening:** A wallet-drainer URL was posted, possibly with a fake "official announcement" tone. Members may already be clicking.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Delete the message immediately. Right-click → Delete.
2. Timeout the poster for 24 hours. Right-click their name → Timeout → 1 day → reason: "Scam link."
3. Post in `#general-chat`: "🚨 A scam link was just removed. We have NEVER announced anything outside `#announcements`. Do not click any link DM'd or posted by non-staff."

**Next 5 minutes:**
4. Check `#audit-messages` — was the scam URL edited from a benign message? If yes, the account is likely a sleeper.
5. Search the URL in `#audit-messages` to see if it was posted in any other channel before being caught. Delete those too.
6. Add the URL to Carl-bot's banned-words filter so it's auto-deleted on re-post.
7. Add the URL to Discord native AutoMod's keyword filter as backup.

**Next hour:**
8. Post in `#scam-alerts`: "📢 Scam alert: a wallet-drainer link impersonating [thing it impersonated] was attempted today. Removed. Members affected: [count if any reported]. As always — the team will NEVER DM you, and all real announcements only happen in `#announcements`."
9. Post a screenshot of the deleted message (with the URL censored) in `#audit-scam-watch` for the team's records.
10. If the scammer's account was < 7 days old, ban (don't just timeout) — and use Discord's "Also delete messages from the past 7 days" option.

**Post-mortem:**
11. In `#staff-chat` next day: was the scammer a verified member, an unverified joiner, or a Holder? If Holder — that's a compromised wallet account, escalate to Admin and re-trigger Vulcan verification on that wallet.

---

### 33.2) Scenario: Mass raid (50+ accounts join in 60 seconds and start posting)

**What's happening:** A coordinated raid. Likely from a raid server. The accounts are usually < 24h old, no avatar, default Discord username.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. **Server lockdown.** Server Settings → Safety Setup → set Verification Level to **Highest** (must have verified phone). This stops new joiners cold.
2. Server Settings → Roles → `@everyone` → Send Messages → ❌ Deny. The whole server goes read-only.
3. Post in `#staff-chat`: "🚨 RAID — server locked. Admin handling."

**Next 5 minutes:**
4. In Server Settings → Members → sort by "Join Date" descending. You see the raid wave at the top.
5. Multi-select all raiders (the ones with default avatars + recent join + no roles) → Ban → "Also delete messages from past 24 hours."
6. If raid is too large to manually select, use Carl-bot: `?ban [user1] [user2] ...` or use a pre-saved Carl-bot command.
7. Re-check `#audit-joins-leaves` to confirm raid wave is over (no new joins for 60+ seconds).

**Next hour:**
8. Once raid is dead, lift the @everyone Send Messages deny.
9. Lower verification level back to Medium (or whatever your normal is).
10. Post in `#announcements`: "🛡️ A small raid was contained at [time] — server is back to normal. Thanks for your patience, no member data or wallets were affected."
11. In `#audit-server` you'll see the verification-level changes auto-logged. That's your forensic timestamp.

**Post-mortem:**
12. Check `#audit-invites` — which invite was used? If a single invite brought all raiders, delete that invite immediately (it's been leaked to a raid server).
13. Going forward, use Carl-bot's auto-anti-raid: "if 10+ joins in 60s → auto-lockdown + ping Admin."

---

### 33.3) Scenario: A moderator's account got hacked

**What's happening:** A mod's behaviour suddenly changes — they're banning people, deleting channels, posting scam links, or DMing members.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. **Admin only:** Server Settings → Roles → take `Moderator ☁️` away from that mod. Right-click their name → Roles → uncheck Moderator.
2. Timeout the account for 28 days (Discord max). This stops further damage instantly.
3. Post in `#staff-chat`: "🚨 [mod's name]'s account compromised. Powers revoked. Real [name] please contact Admin via [out-of-band channel — text/WhatsApp/etc]."

**Next 5 minutes:**
4. In `#audit-mod-actions` — scroll back to when the weird behaviour started. Identify EVERY action they took (bans, kicks, deletes, role grants).
5. **Reverse them.** Unban every person they banned. Restore every role they removed.
6. If they deleted channels, check Discord's server audit log (Server Settings → Audit Log) to see what was deleted — Discord can't restore channels but you can recreate them with the same name+permissions from this doc.

**Next hour:**
7. Once the real mod has recovered their account (changed Discord password, enabled 2FA, signed out all sessions), have them prove identity in `#staff-chat` by posting a pre-agreed phrase only the team knows.
8. Re-grant `Moderator ☁️` only after they confirm 2FA is enabled.
9. Audit all webhooks (`#audit-bots`) created during the compromise window — delete any unfamiliar ones.

**Post-mortem:**
10. Make 2FA mandatory for ALL staff. Server Settings → Safety Setup → Require 2FA for moderation.
11. Add a Carl-bot rule: if any mod issues > 5 bans in 60 seconds, auto-strip the Moderator role and ping @Admin.

---

### 33.4) Scenario: Vulcan breaks — Holders are losing their `Holder 🌌` role

**What's happening:** Members who genuinely hold $CNDY are suddenly seeing the Holder channels disappear. They're DMing/pinging the team.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Check Vulcan's status page (status.vulcan.xyz). If their service is down, this is global, not your problem.
2. Post in `#holder-announcements`: "🌌 Heads up — Vulcan is having an issue verifying wallets right now. Your Holder role may temporarily disappear. Don't sell anything! Don't move wallets! We'll restore as soon as their service is back. Updates here."

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. **DO NOT** start manually granting `Holder 🌌` to people who claim to be holders. That bypasses the verification logic and creates real-world fraud risk.
4. In `#audit-holder-changes` — confirm whether Vulcan mass-revoked roles (you'll see a wave of "role removed" events from the Vulcan bot in a short window). That confirms it's a bot bug, not real holders selling.

**Next hour:**
5. Wait for Vulcan to recover. Re-trigger their re-verification command (`/connect` or as per their dashboard) — usually they auto-restore.
6. Post in `#holder-announcements`: "✅ Vulcan is back. If your role didn't auto-restore, head to `#holder-verify` and click the verify button again."

**Post-mortem:**
7. Pin a "Vulcan downtime" template message in `#staff-chat` so anyone can post the same calm response next time.
8. Keep a backup CSV of holder→Discord-ID mapping (export weekly via Vulcan dashboard) so you can manually reconcile if their service ever has data loss.

---

### 33.5) Scenario: Someone is impersonating Admin or a Mod with a copied avatar + nickname

**What's happening:** A member changed their nickname and avatar to look exactly like a staff member, and is DMing holders asking for seed phrases.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Carl-bot's anti-impersonator filter (section 28.7) should catch this automatically and revert the nickname. If the filter missed (because they used a Unicode look-alike), do it manually:
2. Right-click impersonator → Edit Server Profile → reset nickname.
3. Timeout for 7 days.

**Next 5 minutes:**
4. Post in `#general-chat` and `#holder-chat`: "⚠️ An account just impersonated [staff name]. We've handled it. Reminder: real staff have ONE color (Admin = 💗 Pink, Mods = ☁️ Cloud color), and the Discord role badge appears next to their name. NEVER trust a DM."
5. Add the Unicode characters they used to Carl-bot's banned-words filter so future variants get caught.

**Next hour:**
6. DM (yes, this is the rare time you DM) any holder who interacted with the impersonator in a public channel. Confirm they didn't share anything sensitive.
7. If anyone reports they sent funds or shared a seed phrase, escalate to Admin immediately and post a `#scam-alerts` notice (without naming the victim).

**Post-mortem:**
8. Strengthen the anti-impersonator nickname list — add every common Unicode look-alike (А for A, Е for E, О for O, etc.) to Carl-bot's filter.

---

### 33.6) Scenario: Discord's native AutoMod is over-flagging real members

**What's happening:** AutoMod is silently deleting normal messages. Members complain in `#support` that their message "didn't go through."

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Open `#audit-automod` — see what's being flagged. Identify the rule that's too aggressive.
2. Server Settings → AutoMod → that rule → either lower its sensitivity or add the affected words to its allowlist.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Post in the channel where messages were being eaten: "Sorry team — our anti-spam was too aggressive on the word [X]. Fixed. Re-post if you got blocked."
4. In `#audit-server` you'll see the AutoMod rule edit auto-logged. That's your timestamp.

**Next hour:**
5. Run a test message yourself in a quiet channel to confirm the rule no longer triggers.

**Post-mortem:**
6. Quarterly: review `#audit-automod` to see false-positive rate. If > 10% of flags are false positives, the rule is too broad.

---

### 33.7) Scenario: A holder claims their wallet was drained and they think it was through Discord

**What's happening:** A holder says they lost NFTs/funds and blames a Discord interaction.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. **Stay calm and supportive.** Don't argue. Open a private ticket immediately via `#open-tickets`.
2. Post in the ticket: "We're so sorry. Let's figure this out — please answer these so we can help: (1) which wallet? (2) when did the drain happen (UTC time)? (3) which links did you click in the past 24h? (4) did you sign any transaction? (5) did anyone DM you?"

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. In `#audit-messages` — search by the holder's username in the past 24h. See what links they clicked or who they interacted with.
4. In `#audit-joins-leaves` and `#audit-role-changes` for that user — was their account behaviour normal?

**Next hour:**
5. If the drain came from a fake link posted in your server (and you missed it), this is a 🚨 SEV-1 incident. Pull all admins into `#staff-chat`. Post a public scam alert in `#announcements` AND `#scam-alerts` even if no one else was hit.
6. If the drain came from a phishing site they found outside Discord — provide harm-reduction: "1. Move any remaining assets to a fresh wallet right now. 2. Revoke approvals at revoke.cash. 3. Report the wallet drainer to chainabuse.com."
7. Their `Holder 🌌` role will auto-revoke when Vulcan sees the wallet is empty. That's intended — don't manually re-grant.

**Post-mortem:**
8. Save the ticket transcript. If multiple holders report the same scam vector in a week, you have a campaign — escalate publicly.

---

### 33.8) Scenario: An invite link got leaked to a known raid/bot farm

**What's happening:** Sudden 5x spike in joins, but they're not raiders — they're just bot accounts inflating member count.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Open `#audit-invites` — sort by usage. The leaked invite will be obvious (one invite suddenly used 200 times).
2. Server Settings → Invites → delete that invite.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Use Carl-bot to mass-kick (not ban — they may be innocent compromised accounts) all members who joined via that invite in the last 2 hours. Carl-bot command: `?kick-by-invite [invite-code]` (if your version supports it; otherwise sort `#audit-joins-leaves` by invite and kick manually).
4. Lock down server registration: Verification Level → High temporarily.

**Next hour:**
5. Lower verification level back to normal.
6. Going forward, do NOT publish a permanent vanity-style invite. Use Discord's vanity URL only (Server Settings → Server Profile → Vanity URL), which can't be brute-forced and is tied to your server identity.
7. Audit who created the leaked invite (`#audit-invites` shows creator). If it was a mod, ask them to use vanity URL only going forward.

**Post-mortem:**
8. All public-facing invites (Twitter, Linktree, website) should use ONLY the vanity URL. Personal one-off invites for KOLs/partners should expire in 24h.

---

### 33.9) Scenario: A bot (Carl-bot/Auth/Vulcan/Ticket Tool) goes offline

**What's happening:** A bot's name greys out. It stops responding to commands.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Check the bot's status page (carl.gg/status, status.vulcan.xyz, etc).
2. Post in `#staff-chat`: "🤖 [Bot name] is offline — checked their status page, [global outage / our server only]."

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. **If global outage:** wait. Post in `#announcements`: "Heads up — [bot] is having a service outage. [Affected feature] may be temporarily down. We're monitoring."
4. **If only our server:** kick + re-invite the bot using its official invite link. Re-grant it the same role + permissions per this doc.

**Next hour:**
5. Once it's back, run a test command in `#mod-commands`.
6. If it was Vulcan that went down and Holders' roles are now wrong, see Scenario 33.4.
7. If it was Auth, no new joiners can verify until it's back. Post pinned message in `#verify`: "⚠️ Verify is temporarily unavailable. Please check back in a few minutes."

**Post-mortem:**
8. Track outage frequency in `#audit-bots`. If a bot has > 3 outages a month, evaluate alternatives.

---

### 33.10) Scenario: Discord-wide outage (status.discord.com is red)

**What's happening:** Discord itself is down. Nothing works.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't try to fix anything. Discord's outages always recover on their own.
2. Post on Twitter (your @WHIMSEY account): "Discord is having a global outage — see status.discord.com. Our server is fine, just unreachable. We'll resume normal ops as soon as Discord recovers. Don't panic-sell, don't trust DMs."

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Stay calm on Twitter. The community will see your Twitter post and not panic.

**Next hour:**
4. When Discord recovers, post in `#announcements`: "We're back. Discord's outage didn't affect any of your roles, NFTs, or wallets — those are all on-chain and independent."

**Post-mortem:**
5. Pin a "Discord outage response" template tweet in `#staff-chat` so anyone on the team can post it next time without thinking.

---

### 33.11) Scenario: An admin accidentally deleted a critical channel (e.g. `#announcements`)

**What's happening:** A channel with months of history is gone. Discord cannot restore deleted channels.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't refresh. Don't close Discord. Open `#audit-channels` and `#audit-server` immediately to see who deleted what at exactly what time.
2. Post in `#staff-chat`: "Channel `[name]` deleted accidentally. Recreating now from documentation."

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Recreate the channel using THIS DOCUMENT's spec for that channel — exact name, exact category, exact permission overrides (sections 11–25 + 26.X).
4. If it was an announcements channel, repost the most recent critical announcements (the team's Twitter / pinned tweets serve as backup).

**Next hour:**
5. Apologize publicly in `#general-chat`: "🛠️ We accidentally deleted `#[channel]` and rebuilt it. Pre-deletion message history is unfortunately lost. The pinned posts have been restored."

**Post-mortem:**
6. Add a Carl-bot rule: notify @Admin in `#audit-channels` whenever ANY channel is deleted (separate ping, not just a log entry).
7. Going forward, every "important" channel should have its pinned messages screenshotted weekly and saved to a private team Drive folder.

---

### 33.12) Scenario: A holder is selling a stolen NFT they "won" in a fake giveaway

**What's happening:** Someone in `#trading-post` is offering a $CNDY NFT below floor — it turns out to be stolen.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't accuse publicly. Open a ticket with the seller via `#open-tickets`.
2. Verify on-chain: the NFT's transfer history (Etherscan / Solscan). Was it received from a known scammer wallet? Was there a recent flag on it on OpenSea?

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. If confirmed stolen: remove the seller's `Holder 🌌` role manually (Vulcan won't catch this), and remove the listing message from `#trading-post`.
4. Post in `#trading-post`: "⚠️ A listing was just removed because the NFT was flagged as stolen on-chain. Always verify NFTs at [marketplace link] before buying P2P."

**Next hour:**
5. If the seller knowingly listed stolen, ban them.
6. If they were a victim themselves (received it innocently), educate them. Don't ban innocent victims.

**Post-mortem:**
7. Pin in `#trading-post`: "Before any P2P trade — verify NFT history on [Etherscan/Solscan] and check OpenSea/Magic Eden for flags. WHIMSEY does NOT mediate trades."

---

### 33.13) Scenario: Someone leaks an unreleased team announcement (e.g. a roadmap reveal) before the official drop

**What's happening:** A staff member's screenshot of `#staff-chat` is on Twitter / outside the server.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't denounce on Twitter immediately. Pull all staff into a voice call.
2. Identify the source: in `#audit-messages`, see who was online + who edited/deleted messages around the leak window.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Strip the suspected leaker's `Moderator ☁️` role pending investigation.
4. Save screenshots of the leak from outside the server.

**Next hour:**
5. If you decide to release the announcement early to control the narrative, do so officially in `#announcements`.
6. If you decide NOT to release, address it on Twitter generically: "Speculation circulating. Official news is only ever posted in our server `#announcements` channel."

**Post-mortem:**
7. Move all sensitive plans out of `#staff-chat` and into a smaller `#admin-only` channel that even mods can't see. Update sections 7–9 of this doc accordingly.
8. Add a 24h cool-down rule: any reveal goes from `#admin-only` to `#announcements` directly, never via `#staff-chat`.

---

### 33.14) Scenario: A bug in a giveaway — wrong winner picked

**What's happening:** Carl-bot or your giveaway bot picks a winner who shouldn't be eligible (e.g. didn't have `Holder 🌌` for a holder-only giveaway).

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't reroll yet. Don't DM anyone yet.
2. Verify the winner's eligibility by checking their roles at the time the giveaway ended (`#audit-role-changes` will show this).

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. If they're truly ineligible, post publicly in `#giveaways`: "🎉 The previous winner doesn't meet the eligibility criteria (must hold `Holder 🌌` at giveaway end). Rerolling now — sorry for the confusion!"
4. Reroll using Carl-bot.

**Next hour:**
5. DM the original winner privately (this is one of the rare okay times) to explain politely.
6. Update giveaway template to clearly list "you must have [role] at giveaway end" — and use Carl-bot's eligibility filter feature when setting up future giveaways.

**Post-mortem:**
7. Always pin the eligibility criteria as the FIRST line of any giveaway message.

---

### 33.15) Scenario: Server boost runs out and you lose features (custom URL, more emojis, audio quality)

**What's happening:** A booster un-boosts. Server drops a level. Vanity URL may break, emoji slots shrink.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Check `#audit-boosts` to confirm. See who unboosted.
2. Server Settings → Server Boost Status → see current level.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. If you dropped to Level 0 and lost vanity URL, that link will break. Anyone using it externally will hit a 404.
4. Post in `#announcements`: "📢 Our vanity URL `discord.gg/whimsey` is temporarily unavailable. Use [new invite link] until we're boosted again. Anyone want to boost? 💗"

**Next hour:**
5. Politely thank past boosters in `#momentum-team-pulse`.
6. If a key feature broke, ask Holders if anyone wants to boost (no pressure). A server with 30k NFT supply almost always has someone willing.

**Post-mortem:**
7. Always keep a backup invite link distributed alongside vanity URL.
8. Track boost expiry dates in `#momentum-server-stats` so you have ~48h warning.

---

### 33.16) Scenario: A doxxing attempt — someone is posting another member's real name/address

**What's happening:** Personally identifying information about a community member is being posted. This is a Discord ToS violation AND potentially illegal.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. **Delete the message immediately.**
2. **Permanent ban** the doxxer with "Also delete messages from past 7 days." No warnings. No second chances.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. DM (this is one of the rare appropriate times) the victim: "We just removed a post that included your information. We've banned the poster. We're sorry this happened. If you'd like, we can also leave you a fresh nickname or temporarily hide your account from the server while you recover."
4. Report the doxxer's account to Discord ToS: discord.com/safety/360044103651-Reporting-Abusive-Behavior.

**Next hour:**
5. Search `#audit-messages` for any other posts from the doxxer — delete every one of them globally.
6. Post a generic notice in `#announcements`: "We've removed a doxxing attempt today and banned the offender. WHIMSEY has zero tolerance for sharing personal info about anyone in or outside this server."

**Post-mortem:**
7. Add the victim's real name to Carl-bot's banned-words filter (if they consent) so it can never be posted again.
8. Consider tightening DM filters server-wide.

---

### 33.17) Scenario: A wallet-verification flood — 200 people trying to verify in 5 minutes

**What's happening:** You just dropped a major announcement and verifications are spiking. Vulcan is rate-limiting.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't change anything. Vulcan handles its own queue.
2. Post in `#holder-verify`: "🌌 Lots of verifications happening right now! If yours times out, just click again in 2 minutes — don't panic."

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. Watch `#audit-wallet-verifications` — the throughput should be ~20-30/min steady. If it's totally stalled, see Scenario 33.4.

**Next hour:**
4. After the wave dies, post stats in `#momentum-holder-snapshot` for celebration: "🎉 [N] new Holders verified today!"

**Post-mortem:**
5. For future big drops, pre-warm the team in `#staff-chat` so everyone is on standby for support questions.

---

### 33.18) Scenario: A mod is biased / abusing their power (banning legit members for personal reasons)

**What's happening:** Pattern emerges in `#audit-mod-actions` of one mod issuing more bans than the rest combined, or banning members who post against that mod's opinion.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Don't confront publicly. DM the mod: "Hey, can you hop in `#staff-chat` for a quick check-in? Reviewing today's mod actions together."

**Next 5 minutes:**
2. Pull last 7 days of `#audit-mod-actions` filtered to that mod. Tally by reason.
3. Cross-reference with `#audit-messages` for the banned members — were the bans justified or pretextual?

**Next hour:**
4. If pattern confirms abuse: strip `Moderator ☁️` role. Don't ban them as a member if they were otherwise positive.
5. Unban the affected members and DM them an apology + explanation.

**Post-mortem:**
6. Establish a "two-mod rule" in your team: any ban that isn't an obvious raid/scam needs a second mod's sign-off in `#staff-chat` first.
7. Add Carl-bot rule: any single mod issuing > 3 bans in 24h auto-pings @Admin to review.

---

### 33.19) Scenario: A copyright takedown — someone posts art that the artist demands be removed

**What's happening:** A real artist DMs the team saying their work was posted in `#fan-creations` without consent.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Verify the request is legitimate (check the artist's social, not just an email claim).
2. Delete the post immediately. Better to over-comply than risk a DMCA escalation.

**Next 5 minutes:**
3. DM the member who posted it (politely): "Hey, the original artist asked us to take down [post]. We've removed it. No penalty on you — just letting you know. In the future, please credit artists or only post your own work."
4. Reply to the artist (in whatever channel they reached out): "Removed. Apologies, and thank you for letting us know."

**Next hour:**
5. Pin in `#fan-creations` and `#show-your-whimsey`: "📜 Only post art you made, OR art you have explicit permission to share, OR art with a clear credit + link to the artist."

**Post-mortem:**
6. If the same member has 3+ takedowns, formal warning. If 5+, remove `Verified 🩵`.

### 33.20) Scenario: Someone exposes a hidden staff or audit channel by posting a screenshot

**What's happening:** A mod accidentally screenshotted a staff-only channel and shared it in `#general-chat`, OR a hacker (after compromising a mod) posted internal audit screenshots publicly.

**First 60 seconds:**
1. Delete the message.
2. If a mod did it accidentally, no punishment — just educate.
3. If posted by a compromised account, see Scenario 33.3.

**Next 5 minutes:**
4. Assess what was leaked. Was it a screenshot of an active investigation? A planned reveal? A member's complaint?
5. If a member's name was in the screenshot, DM them an apology.

**Next hour:**
6. Lockdown protocol if leak was sensitive: rotate any compromised links/info immediately.
7. Public response if needed: "We had an internal slip today and a staff screenshot ended up briefly visible. It's been removed and we're tightening our processes."

**Post-mortem:**
8. Standing rule for staff: never screenshot inside staff channels. If you need to share something, use the in-Discord "Reply" feature, not screenshots.

---

### 33.21) THE "WHEN IN DOUBT" DEFAULTS

When something happens that ISN'T in this playbook:

| Doubt | Default action |
|---|---|
| "Should I delete this message?" | Yes. You can always restore via `#audit-messages` if wrong. |
| "Should I ban or timeout?" | **Timeout 24h first.** Ban only if obvious scammer / raider / doxxer. |
| "Should I respond publicly or DM?" | Respond publicly. The only exceptions: doxxing victim, drained holder, accidental giveaway loser. |
| "Should I lock down the channel?" | If you're unsure, yes. Locked is safer than open during chaos. |
| "Should I post on Twitter?" | Only after the situation is contained. Twitter during chaos amplifies chaos. |
| "Is this serious enough to wake Admin?" | If you're asking, the answer is yes. |
| "The audit log shows something weird I don't understand" | Screenshot it, post in `#staff-chat`, ask. Never assume it's nothing. |

---

### 33.22) THE INCIDENT REPORT TEMPLATE

After every incident (33.1 – 33.20), the responding mod files a quick report in `#staff-chat`:

```
📝 INCIDENT REPORT — [Date Time IST]

Type: [scam link / raid / impersonator / etc — reference 33.X]
Severity: [SEV-1 catastrophic / SEV-2 major / SEV-3 minor]
Detected by: [Carl-bot AutoMod / member report / mod patrol / external]
Detection time: [HH:MM IST]
Containment time: [HH:MM IST]
Members affected: [count, or "none"]
Actions taken: [bullet list]
Audit channel references: [#audit-X message links]
Public communication: [if any, link to #announcements post]
Lessons / changes needed: [bullet list]
```

This is the single most important habit. Three months from now, you'll be able to look back at 90 incident reports and see exactly which scams / raids / bot bugs are recurring — and harden against them.

## ✅ DO (34.1–34.7) / 📚 REFERENCE (34.8–34.12) — 34) BOT AUTOPILOT — THE 24/7 AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS SETUP 💗❄️

**The promise of this section:** when you and the team are asleep, working, eating, traveling, or just unavailable — the server keeps running smoothly, dangerous things get blocked automatically, the daily/weekly/monthly momentum reports post on time, and you only get pinged when a HUMAN is genuinely needed. Everything else is handled by the bots.

This section is **click-by-click**. Every dashboard path is spelled out. Every threshold is given. Every embed template is ready to paste. By the end you'll have a server that runs itself.

---

### 34.1) THE AUTOPILOT PHILOSOPHY (read first, takes 60 seconds)

A perfectly tuned bot setup does FOUR things:

1. **PREVENTS** bad things from happening (AutoMod, anti-raid, anti-impersonator, anti-link).
2. **DETECTS** events as they happen (logging every event type to the right audit channel).
3. **REPORTS** the state of the server on a schedule (daily/weekly/monthly momentum recaps).
4. **ESCALATES** to a human ONLY when a human is genuinely needed (smart pings instead of dumb spam).

Most servers fail at #4 — they ping the team for everything, the team gets ping fatigue, and real emergencies get missed. We solve this with **tiered alerts** (sections 34.7).

---

### 34.2) BOT-BY-BOT DASHBOARD SETUP — IN ORDER

Set up the bots in this exact order. Each one depends on the previous being live.

#### Order:
1. **Carl-bot** — the brain (logging, AutoMod, scheduling, autopilot reports)
2. **Auth** — the front door (verification only)
3. **Vulcan** — the wallet bouncer (holder verification only)
4. **Ticket Tool** — the customer service desk (private support only)
5. **NFT Tracker** — the on-chain watcher (section 32 + 34.7)

---

### 34.3) CARL-BOT FULL AUTOPILOT CONFIGURATION (the most important bot)

Carl-bot does ~70% of all the autopilot work. Get this perfect and the server effectively runs itself.

#### 34.3.1) Initial setup

1. Go to **carl.gg** → "Login with Discord" → "Add Carl-bot to server" → pick WHIMSEY.
2. On the OAuth page, grant Carl-bot the suggested permissions BUT then immediately:
3. Go to **Server Settings → Roles → Carl-bot** → set its color to a calm cloud-grey (so it visually blends, not screams).
4. Move `Carl-bot` role in the role list to position **#3** (under Admin 💗 and Moderator ☁️) — confirmed in section 6.
5. Open **carl.gg/dashboard → WHIMSEY**.

#### 34.3.2) Prefix and basic settings

- **Dashboard → Server → Settings:**
  - Prefix: `?` (default)
  - Embed color: `#FFB6C1` (your pink) so all Carl-bot embeds match brand
  - Delete commands after use: ✅ ON (keeps channels clean)
  - Mention prefix: ✅ ON (so `@Carl-bot help` also works)

#### 34.3.3) Logging — bind every channel exactly per section 28.2

This is the foundation of "always supervising." Open **Dashboard → Logging** and go through every event type:

For each event in the section 28.2 tables, click "Enable" and set the destination channel from the dropdown. Don't skip any. If a channel doesn't exist yet, go create it first then come back.

**Important:** Carl-bot's logging dropdown groups events. Map them like this:

| Carl-bot logging group | Destination |
|---|---|
| **Server Events** | `#audit-server` |
| **Channel Events** | `#audit-channels` |
| **Role Events** | `#audit-roles` |
| **Member Updates** | `#audit-member-updates` |
| **Nickname Updates** | `#audit-nicknames` |
| **Voice Events** | `#audit-voice` |
| **Member Joins/Leaves** | `#audit-joins-leaves` |
| **Message Events** | `#audit-messages` |
| **Mod Actions** | `#audit-mod-actions` |
| **Role Add/Remove** | `#audit-role-changes` |
| **Emoji/Sticker Events** | `#audit-emoji-stickers` |
| **Thread/Forum Events** | `#audit-threads-events` |
| **Invite Events** | `#audit-invites` |
| **Bot/Webhook Events** | `#audit-bots` |
| **AutoMod Events** | `#audit-automod` and `#audit-scam-watch` (mirror to both) |
| **Boost Events** | `#audit-boosts` |

**Verify:** kick yourself from a test channel. Check `#audit-channels` — there should be a log entry within 2 seconds. If yes, logging is live.

#### 34.3.4) AutoMod — paste this exact ruleset

**Dashboard → AutoMod → Add new rule.** Create EACH of these:

**Rule A: Anti-invite (auto-block external server invites)**
- Trigger: `discord.gg/`, `discord.com/invite/`
- Whitelist: your own server's invite code
- Action: Delete message + add 1 strike to user

  ```
  admin, moderator, mod, support, team, official, founder, whimsey support, whimsey team, 
  whimsey staff, whimsey official, аdmin, mоderator, supрort, оfficial
  ```
- Action: Auto-revert nickname + 1-hour timeout + log to `#audit-nicknames` AND `#audit-mod-actions`

**Rule J: Anti-raid (the most important one)**
- Trigger: > 10 joins in 60 seconds
- Action: Auto-enable Discord's Verification Level → Highest + ping `@Admin` in `#audit-mod-actions`
- Auto-revert verification level after 30 min of no new joins

**Rule K: Account-age gate**
- Trigger: any new member whose account is < 24 hours old
- Action: do NOT block them, but flag with ⚠️ in `#audit-joins-leaves` so mods can monitor
- Also: auto-add a `🆕 New Account` role to them so they can be filtered later

**Rule L: Suspicious-link domain filter**
- Trigger: any URL containing `bit.ly`, `tinyurl`, `t.co/` outside `#announcements`, or unicode-confusable domains (e.g. `0pensea.io`, `magiceden.app` if your real one is `.io`)
- Action: Delete + post in `#audit-scam-watch`
- Whitelist: your real official domains

#### 34.3.5) Auto-responses — paste these triggers

**Dashboard → Tags / AutoResponder → Add:**

| Trigger words | Bot reply |
|---|---|
| how do i verify, how to verify, where do i verify | "Head to `#access-info`, then click Verify in `#verify` 💗" |
| is this a scam, is this real, got a dm | "Read `#scam-alerts` — the team will NEVER DM you first." |

| what is whimsey, tell me about whimsey | "WHIMSEY is a 30,000-supply NFT collection with the $CNDY ticker. Read `#about-whimsey` and `#roadmap` for the full story 🌌💗" |

#### 34.3.6) Scheduled messages — the "always-on" momentum reports

**Dashboard → Scheduled Messages → Add new:**

Create each of these as recurring scheduled embeds. Carl-bot supports `cron` style schedules.

##### Schedule 1: Daily server recap → `#momentum-daily-recap` at 23:55 IST

- Schedule: every day at 23:55 IST
- Channel: `#momentum-daily-recap`
- Embed title: `📊 WHIMSEY Daily Recap — {date}`
- Embed color: `#FFB6C1`
- Embed body:
  ```
  🆕 Joins today: {member_count_change_24h}
  💬 Active members today: {active_member_count_24h}
  📈 Total members now: {member_count}
  🌌 Verified Holders: {role_count:Holder 🌌}
  🩵 Verified members: {role_count:Verified 🩵}
  🛡️ AutoMod hits today: {automod_hits_24h}
  🎫 Open tickets right now: {ticket_open_count}
  
  Tomorrow we keep growing. ❄️
  ```
- Auto-pin latest? ✅ Yes (so the most recent recap is always pinned)
- Auto-unpin previous? ✅ Yes

> If a placeholder isn't supported by Carl-bot's free tier, replace with a `?stats` Carl-bot command that the team can run manually. Either way, the schedule fires.

##### Schedule 2: Weekly server recap → `#momentum-weekly-recap` at Sunday 23:55 IST

- Schedule: every Sunday 23:55 IST
- Channel: `#momentum-weekly-recap`
- Embed title: `📊 WHIMSEY Weekly Recap — Week of {week_start_date}`
- Embed body:
  ```
  📈 Net members this week: {member_count_change_7d}
  💬 Total messages this week: {message_count_7d}
  🟢 Avg active members/day: {avg_dau_7d}
  🔝 Most active channel: {top_channel_7d}
  🏆 Top contributor: {top_contributor_7d}
  🌌 Holders gained: {holder_gained_7d}
  😢 Holders lost: {holder_lost_7d}
  🛡️ Total AutoMod actions: {automod_hits_7d}
  🎫 Tickets handled: {tickets_closed_7d}
  
  Onwards. 💗
  ```

##### Schedule 3: Monthly recap → `#momentum-monthly-recap` on last day of month 23:55 IST

- Schedule: every month on the last day at 23:55 IST
- Same template as weekly but with 30-day numbers + month-over-month comparison.

##### Schedule 4: Daily holder snapshot reminder → `#staff-chat` at 00:00 IST

- Schedule: every day at 00:00 IST
- Channel: `#staff-chat`
- Message: `📸 @Moderator @Admin — Holder snapshot time. Run /list-holders in #mod-commands and post the count + new + lost in #momentum-holder-snapshot. Takes 2 min.`

##### Schedule 5: Daily safety reminder rotation → `#general-chat` at 12:00 IST

Use Carl-bot's "rotate messages" feature (Dashboard → Scheduled Messages → Add → Rotation):

- Mon: "🩵 Reminder: never share your seed phrase. The team will NEVER DM you first."
- Tue: "🌌 Holders — re-verify in `#holder-verify` if your role goes missing."
- Wed: "🚨 Suspicious DM? Screenshot it and report in `#scam-alerts`."
- Thu: "✨ Forgot how to verify? Head to `#access-info`."
- Fri: "🎉 Got fan art? Drop it in `#fan-creations` or `#show-your-whimsey`."
- Sat: "🗳️ Vote on community polls in `#polls`."
- Sun: "📊 Weekly recap is up in `#momentum-weekly-recap` (staff only)."

##### Schedule 6: Daily nudge to staff → `#whimsey-of-the-day` at 14:00 IST

"📌 Time for today's Whimsey of the Day! Pick one and post."

##### Schedule 7: Weekly community contributor recognition → `#momentum-team-pulse` Mon 12:00 IST

Embed listing top 3 message-count + top 3 reaction-receivers + top 3 thread starters from past week. Use this to pick a "Whimsey of the Week" hero.

##### Schedule 8: Weekly server stats refresh → `#momentum-server-stats` Mon 09:00 IST

Pinned embed with current totals. Carl-bot edits the pinned embed in place (so the channel stays clean — only one always-current message).

##### Schedule 9: Hourly bot health check → `#audit-bots`

Every hour at :00, Carl-bot posts "✅ Carl-bot heartbeat — all systems nominal." If you don't see this for > 90 minutes, Carl-bot is offline → see Crisis Scenario 33.9.

#### 34.3.7) Auto-slowmode

**Dashboard → Auto Slowmode → Enable on:**
- `#general-chat` — trigger at 30 msg/min, set to 5s slowmode
- `#whimsey-talk` — trigger at 30 msg/min, set to 5s slowmode
- `#trading-post` — trigger at 20 msg/min, set to 10s slowmode
- `#support` — trigger at 20 msg/min, set to 10s slowmode

#### 34.3.8) Welcome system

**Dashboard → Welcome → Configure:**
- DM new joiners: "Welcome to WHIMSEY! Read `#access-info` and verify in `#verify` to unlock the server. The team will NEVER DM you first. 💗"
- After they get `Verified 🩵` role: post a welcome card in `#welcome` with their avatar + "Welcome to WHIMSEY, {user}! 🩵"
- After they get `Holder 🌌` role: post a celebration in `#holder-chat` "🎉 {user} is now a Holder! Welcome to the family 🌌"

#### 34.3.9) Reaction roles for opt-in pings

**Dashboard → Reaction Roles → Create panel in `#roles`:**

```
Pick the pings you want:
🔔 — Announcement Pings
🎉 — Giveaway Pings
🗳️ — Poll Pings
🧑‍🎨 — Fan Artist
🛒 — Trader Pings
```

Each emoji maps to a self-assigned role. Admin can `@Announcement Pings` instead of `@everyone` for non-critical updates.

#### 34.3.10) Custom Carl-bot tags (team productivity)

**Dashboard → Tags → Create:**

| Tag | What it posts |
|---|---|
| `?rules` | Quick rules summary embed |
| `?scam` | Scam-warning template (for `#scam-alerts` use) |
| `?verify` | Verify instructions |
| `?holder` | Holder-verify instructions |
| `?stats` | Live stats summary |
| `?snapshot` | Pulls latest from `#momentum-holder-snapshot` |
| `?lockdown #channel` | Locks the channel (Send Messages = ❌ for @everyone) |
| `?unlock #channel` | Reverses lockdown |
| `?safety` | Reposts the "team will NEVER DM you" warning |
| `?roadmap` | Reposts the latest roadmap pin |

---

### 34.4) AUTH — VERIFICATION AUTOPILOT

Auth is a one-purpose bot. Set it once, then forget it.

#### 34.4.1) Setup
1. Invite Auth via its official site (be careful — there are multiple bots called "Auth"; use the verified one with the highest member count).
2. Grant ONLY: View Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Manage Roles.
3. Move Auth role to position **#4** in role hierarchy (under Carl-bot, above Vulcan).
4. Auth role MUST be ABOVE `Verified 🩵` so it can grant that role.

#### 34.4.2) Configure the verify panel

In `#verify`, Auth's slash command: `/setup`
- Verified role: `Verified 🩵`
- Verification type: Captcha (NOT just a button — captcha stops bots cold)
- Captcha difficulty: Medium
- Failure action: Kick after 3 failed attempts
- Success message: "🩵 Verified! Welcome to WHIMSEY — explore away."

#### 34.4.3) Anti-bot extras

- Enable: account-age check (block accounts < 1 day old from even attempting)
- Enable: avatar check (block accounts with default avatar from verifying — optional, slightly aggressive)
- Enable: send verification log to `#audit-mod-actions`

---

### 34.5) VULCAN — HOLDER VERIFICATION AUTOPILOT

#### 34.5.1) Setup

1. Invite Vulcan from vulcan.xyz/discord. They'll walk you through their guided setup.
2. Move Vulcan role to position **#7** (under Auth, above Ticket Tool).
3. Must be ABOVE `Holder 🌌` so it can grant that role.

#### 34.5.2) Configure the token gate

In Vulcan's Command Center:
- Add your $CNDY contract address.
- Token type: ERC-721 (Ethereum) / SPL (Solana) / etc — match your chain.
- Minimum balance: 1
- Role to grant: `Holder 🌌`
- Re-check frequency: every 4 hours (catches sales/transfers within 4h max)
- Verification channel: `#holder-verify`
- Welcome message: "🌌 Wallet verified — welcome, Holder."
- Failure message: "We couldn't find $CNDY in this wallet. Buy at [marketplace], then re-verify here."

#### 34.5.3) Logging

- Send all wallet-verification events to `#audit-wallet-verifications`
- Send all role-grant/revoke events to `#audit-holder-changes`

#### 34.5.4) Backup & resilience

- Weekly: export the holder→Discord-ID mapping from Vulcan dashboard. Save to a private team Drive folder. This is your insurance policy if Vulcan ever has data loss (Crisis 33.4).

---

### 34.6) TICKET TOOL — SUPPORT DESK AUTOPILOT

#### 34.6.1) Setup

1. Invite Ticket Tool. Move role to position **#6**.
2. In Ticket Tool dashboard → Add panel to `#open-tickets`.

#### 34.6.2) Configure the ticket panel

- Buttons: `[General Question] [Wallet / Holder Issue] [Scam Report] [Bug / Server Issue]`
- Each button creates a private channel inside `🎫 | TICKETS` category.
- Auto-assign to: `Moderator ☁️`
- Auto-greeting message in the new ticket: "Hi! A team member will help you shortly. Please describe your issue in detail. 💗"
- Auto-close: if no member response for 48h, ask "Still need help?" — if no answer in another 24h, auto-close.
- Auto-transcript: when closed, post full transcript to `#ticket-logs` AND a one-line summary to `#audit-tickets`.

#### 34.6.3) Pre-typed responses (saves the team typing)

In Ticket Tool → Saved Replies → add:
- "I-need-wallet" → "Please share your wallet address (just the public 0x... address, NEVER your seed phrase) so we can verify your holder status."
- "Scam-confirmed" → "Confirmed scam. Please don't sign any transaction. Move remaining assets to a fresh wallet. Revoke approvals at revoke.cash."
- "Closing-no-response" → "Closing this ticket since we haven't heard back. Re-open anytime via `#open-tickets`. 💗"

---

### 34.7) NFT TRACKER — ON-CHAIN COLLECTION FEED AUTOPILOT 📡

The 5th core bot. Once configured, it runs entirely on its own — every $CNDY mint, sale, listing, transfer auto-posts to `#momentum-collection-feed` within seconds of the on-chain event.

#### 34.7.1) Setup (full step-by-step is in section 32 — autopilot summary here)

1. Invite via `nftsalesbot.com` (Ethereum/Polygon) or `hashlist.com` (Solana). Pick the one matching your chain.
2. On the OAuth screen, grant ONLY: View Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files, Read Message History, Use External Emojis. **Uncheck everything else.**
3. Move the auto-created `NFT Tracker` role to position **#6** in the role list (under Ticket Tool, above Holder 🌌).
4. **Strip every server-wide permission** from the role. The bot only needs channel-level allow on `#momentum-collection-feed`.
5. Open `#momentum-collection-feed` → ⚙️ Edit Channel → Permissions → add the `NFT Tracker` role with View / Send / Embed / Attach / Read History / External Emojis all ✅ Allow.

#### 34.7.2) The watch configuration (paste this in the bot's dashboard)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | WHIMSEY |
| Collection name | WHIMSEY ($CNDY) |
| Contract address | `0xYourContractAddressHere` (or Solana mint address) |
| Output channel | `#momentum-collection-feed` |
| Events to track | ✅ Sales, ✅ Listings, ✅ De-listings, ✅ Transfers, ✅ Mints |
| Minimum sale price filter | None (you want all 30k supply movements) |
| Currency primary | ETH (or SOL if Solana) |
| Currency secondary | INR |
| Embed style | Rich embed with NFT image |
| Marketplaces | ✅ OpenSea ✅ Magic Eden ✅ Blur ✅ LooksRare ✅ X2Y2 (tick all) |
| Re-check frequency | Real-time (event-driven, not polling) |

#### 34.7.3) Auto-tagging rules (advanced — most bots support this)

Set the bot to add a contextual emoji prefix based on the event:

| Event type | Embed prefix |
|---|---|
| Standard sale (under 1 ETH) | 🛒 SOLD |
| Whale sale (over 1 ETH) | 🐋 WHALE SALE |
| Listing | 🏷️ LISTED |
| De-listing | ⏸️ DELISTED |
| Transfer (no price) | 🔄 TRANSFER |
| Mint | ✨ NEW MINT |
| Floor-changing sale (sold AT or BELOW current floor) | 📉 FLOOR HIT |

This lets the team scan `#momentum-collection-feed` and instantly understand the vibe of the day — lots of 🐋 = healthy demand; lots of 📉 = floor pressure.

#### 34.7.4) Cross-bot interaction with Carl-bot

Carl-bot watches `#momentum-collection-feed` for unusual patterns. Add this Carl-bot AutoMod custom rule:

- **Trigger:** if `#momentum-collection-feed` receives > 20 sale embeds in 10 minutes
- **Action:** Carl-bot pings `@Moderator` in `#staff-chat` with: "🚨 Unusual on-chain activity — 20+ sales in 10 min. Floor may be moving fast. Check `#momentum-collection-feed`."

This is your early-warning system for floor crashes, sweep events, or coordinated dumps.

Add a second rule:

- **Trigger:** if a single wallet appears as the BUYER in 5+ sale embeds in 60 minutes
- **Action:** Carl-bot pings `@Moderator` with: "🐋 Whale alert — wallet `0x…` has bought 5+ in the past hour. Consider reaching out (DM via mod account, NEVER from official @WHIMSEY)."

Whales love being noticed. This turns the bot's data into a relationship-building tool.

#### 34.7.5) Daily on-chain rollup → `#momentum-daily-recap`

Add a new line to Carl-bot's daily recap embed (section 34.3.6, Schedule 1):

```
📡 On-chain today:
   🛒 Sales: {sales_count_24h}
   🏷️ New listings: {listings_count_24h}
   🐋 Whale sales (>1 ETH): {whale_count_24h}
   ✨ New mints: {mints_count_24h}
   💰 Total volume: {volume_24h_eth} ETH (~₹{volume_24h_inr})
```

If Carl-bot can't pull these numbers natively, the team runs `/track stats` on the NFT Tracker bot daily and pastes into the recap manually. Either way, the team sees Discord activity and on-chain activity side-by-side every night.

#### 34.7.6) Tier-3 alerts the NFT Tracker triggers

Add these to the Tier 3 alert list (section 34.8 below):

- A single wallet sells > 10 $CNDY in 60 minutes (potential exit liquidity event) → ping `@Admin`
- Floor drops > 30% in 60 minutes → ping `@Admin`
- A wallet known to be a scammer (from your blocklist) buys/sells $CNDY → ping `@Admin`

Most bots support per-event webhooks for these triggers. Configure in the bot's dashboard → Alerts.

#### 34.7.7) Health check

The hourly heartbeat in section 34.8 should also cover this bot:

- Carl-bot scheduled job: every 4 hours, check if `#momentum-collection-feed` has received any embed in the past 4 hours.
- If empty AND your collection has any trading volume in that window (you can sanity-check on OpenSea), ping `@Admin` with: "🚨 NFT Tracker may be offline — no embeds in 4h despite known on-chain activity. Check status."

#### 34.7.8) What "good" looks like after 1 week of running

By day 7, you should see:
- ~20–200 embeds per day in `#momentum-collection-feed` (depends on collection activity)
- Zero false positives (no spam)
- Clear vibe-check at a glance — green sea of sales = healthy, red sea of de-listings = quiet

### 34.8) TIERED ALERT SYSTEM — WHEN BOTS PING HUMANS

The whole point of autopilot is: **bots handle 99% of events silently. Bots only ping humans for things that actually need a human.**

Configure these alert tiers in Carl-bot:

#### Tier 1: Silent (no ping, just log)

These events log to audit channels but never ping anyone:
- Every message edit / delete
- Every join / leave
- Every role grant by a bot
- Every channel position move
- Every emoji/sticker change
- Every voice activity
- Every standard AutoMod hit (anti-caps, anti-spam single user)

#### Tier 2: Notify Mods (ping `@Moderator`)

Bots ping `@Moderator` (a notification, not a crisis):
- Banned-words filter triggered (`#audit-scam-watch`)
- Suspicious link from a member (`#audit-scam-watch`)
- New ticket opened in `#open-tickets`
- Same user gets 3+ AutoMod strikes in a day
- Member with `Holder 🌌` role gets timed out (something might be wrong)
- A new bot/integration gets added to the server

Configure: in Carl-bot → AutoMod → each rule → "Notify role: @Moderator"

#### Tier 3: Wake Admins (ping `@Admin`)

Bots ping `@Admin` (this is "wake me up if I'm asleep"):
- Anti-raid triggered (10+ joins in 60s)
- A mod issued > 5 bans in 60s (Crisis 33.3 trigger)
- A channel was deleted (anyone)
- A role with permissions was created or its permissions changed (anyone)
- A webhook was created in a non-momentum channel
- A bot/integration was REMOVED from server
- Server-level settings changed (verification level, AutoMod rules, vanity URL)
- Carl-bot itself loses its Manage Server permission
- Any role above `Verified 🩵` is granted to a member who didn't have it before

Configure: in Carl-bot → Logging → each event → "Mention role: @Admin"

#### Tier 4: All-hands (ping `@everyone` in `#staff-chat`)

Reserved for the absolute worst:
- Mass-ban event (> 20 bans in 5 min by a single account — possible compromised admin)
- Server boost level dropped from 3 to 0 (you lost vanity URL)
- All audit channels stopped receiving events for > 10 minutes (logging is broken)

This tier should fire MAYBE once a year. If it's firing more, lower its sensitivity.

---

### 34.9) AUDIT-CHANNEL HEARTBEAT MONITORING (so you know your eyes are open)

The audit system is your nervous system. If it stops working silently, you're blind. Add this monitoring:

1. Carl-bot Schedule → every hour at :00, post `✅ Heartbeat` in `#audit-mod-actions`.
2. Carl-bot AutoMod custom rule → if `#audit-mod-actions` hasn't received a message in 90 minutes, ping `@Admin` in `#staff-chat` with: `🚨 #audit-mod-actions has been silent for >90 min — Carl-bot may be offline. Check status.`
3. Same for `#audit-messages` (which should always have constant traffic).

This means: even if Carl-bot dies, you find out within 90 minutes — automatically.

---

### 34.10) THE "WHEN HUMANS ARE GENUINELY NEEDED" CHECKLIST

After all the above is configured, here are the ONLY things humans need to do regularly:

| Task | Frequency | Who | Time required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Run `/list-holders` and post snapshot | Daily | Any mod | 2 min |
| Read `#momentum-daily-recap` | Daily | Admin | 30 sec |
| Read `#momentum-weekly-recap` | Weekly | Admin + mods | 2 min |
| Respond to `#open-tickets` | As they come | Mods | varies |
| Post in `#announcements` | When there's news | Admin only | varies |
| Pick "Whimsey of the Week" from `#momentum-team-pulse` | Weekly | Admin | 2 min |
| Review `#audit-mod-actions` for any anomalies | Weekly | Admin | 5 min |
| Review `#audit-server` for any unauthorized server changes | Weekly | Admin | 2 min |
| Export Vulcan holder→Discord-ID backup | Weekly | Admin | 2 min |
| Quarterly: tune AutoMod rules based on `#audit-automod` false-positive rate | Quarterly | Admin | 30 min |
| Crisis response when a Tier 3 or Tier 4 ping fires | As needed | Admin | varies (Section 33) |

**Total weekly human time required: ~30 minutes.** The bots do the rest.

### 34.11) PRE-FLIGHT VERIFICATION — TEST THE AUTOPILOT BEFORE LAUNCH

Before you publish your invite link to Twitter, do this 30-minute test with a second Discord account:

1. **Verify flow:** Join with second account → land in `#access-info` → click verify in `#verify` → captcha → get `Verified 🩵` → see the rest of the server.
   - ✅ Welcome card posted in `#welcome`
   - ✅ Join logged in `#audit-joins-leaves`
   - ✅ Role grant logged in `#audit-role-changes`

2. **Holder flow:** Use Vulcan `/connect` → verify a wallet that holds $CNDY → get `Holder 🌌`.
   - ✅ Verification logged in `#audit-wallet-verifications`
   - ✅ Role grant logged in `#audit-holder-changes`
   - ✅ Celebration posted in `#holder-chat`

3. **AutoMod test:** Post "free mint click here" in `#general-chat`.
   - ✅ Message deleted within 2 seconds
   - ✅ Logged in `#audit-scam-watch`
   - ✅ Mods pinged via Tier 2

4. **Anti-spam test:** Post 6 messages in 3 seconds.
   - ✅ You get 10-min timeout
   - ✅ Logged in `#audit-scam-watch`

5. **Anti-impersonator test:** Change second-account nickname to "WHIMSEY Support".
   - ✅ Auto-reverted within 5 seconds
   - ✅ Logged in `#audit-nicknames` AND `#audit-mod-actions`

6. **Ticket test:** Click `[General Question]` in `#open-tickets`.
   - ✅ Private channel created in `🎫 | TICKETS`
   - ✅ Greeting message posted
   - ✅ Mods pinged via Tier 2
   - Close the ticket → ✅ transcript in `#ticket-logs` + summary in `#audit-tickets`.

7. **Schedule test:** Wait until 23:55 IST (or temporarily set a test schedule for 1 minute from now).
   - ✅ Daily recap posts in `#momentum-daily-recap`

8. **Heartbeat test:** Confirm Carl-bot heartbeat ✅ posted at last hour mark in `#audit-mod-actions`.

If ALL 8 pass — your autopilot is fully live. Launch with confidence. ❄️💗

### 34.12) THE GOLDEN RULE OF AUTOPILOT

**The bots are silent partners. They never sleep. They never forget. They never get angry. But they also never have judgment.**

That's why every Tier 3 and Tier 4 ping in section 34.8 needs a human. The bots flag, the human decides. The bots execute, the human reviews. The bots report, the human acts on the insight.

When this loop is healthy, the team can be away for 12 hours and the server is still safe, growing, and momentum-tracked. When you come back online, you read 1 daily recap, scan 1 audit channel for Tier 3+ events, and you're caught up in 5 minutes.

That is what "the bots manage the server on our behalf" actually looks like in practice. 💗❄️🌌🩵

### 36.7) TOOL CHANGELOG — EVERYTHING IS LOGGED

Every tool call that makes a change is automatically logged to the WHIMSEY change log. The log is visible on the Updates feed (`/updates`) and in the Live Discord Activity Feed on the home page. Each log entry captures:

- The tool name
- A human-readable description of what was done
- A detail line (channel name, message preview, role name, reason, etc.)
- A timestamp

This means Lyra always has a complete, auditable record of everything WHIMSEY AI did — every message sent, every role assigned, every member kicked, every doc edit. Nothing is silent.

---

## 📚 SECTION 37 — REFERENCE: WHIMSEY AI CAN EDIT THIS DOCUMENT

> 📚 **REFERENCE MODE — This section explains how WHIMSEY AI can directly update the guide you are reading right now.**

---

### 37.1) THE UPDATE_DOC_SECTION TOOL

WHIMSEY AI has a tool called `update_doc_section` that allows it to directly edit this file — `WHIMSEY_DISCORD_SETUP.md` — the guide you are reading right now.

This means: when Lyra makes a decision that belongs in the guide (a new rule, a changed permission, a Phase D note, a post-mint update), WHIMSEY AI can write it in immediately. The guide stays current automatically.

---

### 37.2) THE TWO MODES

**Mode 1: `append`**
Adds a completely new section at the end of the document. Use this for:
- New phases (Phase D, Phase E, etc.)
- Post-mint decisions and updates
- New bot configurations
- Meeting notes or decisions that should live permanently in the guide

**Mode 2: `replace_section`**
Finds an existing section by its exact heading and replaces it with new content. Use this for:
- Correcting outdated permission settings
- Updating role names or colors after a decision change
- Revising a bot setup section after configuring it differently
- Keeping phase documentation current as the server evolves

---

### 37.3) HOW TO TRIGGER A DOC UPDATE

Lyra can trigger a doc update just by saying it in conversation:

> "Add a note that we decided to give Moderators access to #holder-chat."
> → WHIMSEY AI appends a new section documenting this decision.

> "Update the Carl-bot setup section with the new AutoMod rules we configured."
> → WHIMSEY AI uses replace_section to rewrite that section.

> "Write up what we decided today and add it to the guide."
> → WHIMSEY AI drafts and appends a full summary of the session's decisions.

WHIMSEY AI can also add doc updates proactively — whenever a significant decision is made in chat, it can offer to write it into the guide without being asked.

---

### 37.4) WHAT GETS LOGGED

Every `update_doc_section` call is logged to the WHIMSEY change log, exactly like any other tool call. The log entry captures:
- What changed (append vs replace, section heading)
- A summary of what was written
- A preview of the first 120 characters of content added
- Timestamp

The guide is always in version history via the project's automatic checkpoints, so no edit is ever lost or unrecoverable.

---

### 37.5) THE GUIDE AS A LIVING DOCUMENT

This guide was written as a complete static reference at the start. But as the server goes live, bots get configured, decisions get made, and the community evolves — the guide should evolve with it.

WHIMSEY AI's `update_doc_section` tool makes this possible without Lyra ever needing to touch a text editor. She just tells WHIMSEY AI what happened, and the guide stays current.

The goal: by the time WHIMSEY is a year old, this document should read like the real operating manual of a running company — not just a setup guide for something that hasn't started yet.

---

## 🗂️ Private AI Conversation Archive

To preserve important founder conversations outside the app chat interface, WHIMSEY includes a private Discord archive channel:

- **Channel:** `#whimsey-ai-history`
- **Location:** `🔒 | STAFF`
- **Purpose:** Store important conversations, summaries, decisions, planning notes, and operational context between Lyra and WHIMSEY AI
- **Visibility:** Private — intended for Lyra and internal operations only

### How it should be used
- Save important planning conversations here when they need to be revisited later
- Store summaries of key strategy discussions
- Keep important founder context accessible even if the app chat thread is not available
- Use this as a reference archive, not as a public-facing channel

This channel is a backup memory layer for WHIMSEY operations. It does not replace the app chat interface, but it ensures important conversations can be preserved inside Discord itself.

---

## 💬 WHIMSEY AI HISTORY ARCHIVE

A private text channel called **#whimsey-ai-history** exists as Lyra's internal archive with WHIMSEY AI.

**Purpose:**
- Store important conversations between Lyra and WHIMSEY AI
- Keep planning notes, decisions, and summaries in one place
- Reflect section-by-section build progress so Lyra can revisit what happened
- Preserve operational context inside Discord even when Lyra is away

**Privacy:**
- `@everyone` = **View Channel ❌ Deny**
- `WHIMSEY AI` = **View Channel ✅ Allow**, **Send Messages ✅ Allow**, **Read Message History ✅ Allow**
- This channel should remain private to Lyra and internal ops only

**Operating rule:**
After each meaningful build section or planning segment, WHIMSEY AI posts a short reflection or summary in **#whimsey-ai-history** so Lyra has an internal running record inside Discord.

---

## 🤖 WHIMSEY AI Conversation Archive

Private archive channel added: **#whimsey-ai-history**

**Purpose:** Store dated summaries and reports of Lyra ↔ WHIMSEY AI conversations inside Discord so important planning, decisions, and progress notes stay accessible in-server.

**Access:** Private internal archive channel. Visible only to Lyra / Admin-level access and WHIMSEY AI.

**Operating rule:** After each meaningful conversation section, WHIMSEY AI should post a timestamped summary/report in **#whimsey-ai-history**. This channel is an internal archive, not a public community channel.

**Important limitation:** This is a manual/operational archive inside Discord. It does not automatically sync every app message unless WHIMSEY AI posts the summary/report there.

---

## 🗃️ WHIMSEY AI Conversation Archive Policy

A private internal archive channel exists for Lyra and WHIMSEY AI to preserve important working sessions, planning summaries, operational notes, and decision recaps.

### Archive channel
- **Channel name:** `#whimsey-ai-history`
- **Purpose:** store session summaries, planning notes, important conversation recaps, and structured records of meaningful work with Lyra
- **Visibility:** private internal channel only

### Archive operating rule
WHIMSEY AI should create a dated session note after each important conversation or work session, especially when the conversation includes:
- strategic planning
- Discord build progress
- post-mint operations planning
- X / content strategy planning
- major questions and answers Lyra may want to revisit
- confirmed decisions or clarified operating rules

### Format for archive entries
Each archive entry should be written like a short internal report and include:
- date
- approximate time or session window when relevant
- session topic
- what Lyra asked
- what WHIMSEY AI advised or did
- any confirmed next steps
- any decisions logged separately

### Important limitation
This Discord archive channel is a manual/internal record created by WHIMSEY AI. It is not a guaranteed raw transcript of every app chat message. It is the official running archive of meaningful sessions and summaries.

---

## Session Note — 2026-05-04 — Discord Build Start, Autopilot Expectations, and Chat Archive Policy

### Summary
This session captured Lyra's decision to begin the Discord server build now as a one-time foundational setup, with WHIMSEY AI handling ongoing operational oversight afterward. It also established the intended use of autopilot during periods when Lyra is away, and formalized the practice of creating session-note style documentation for important conversations.

### What was discussed
- Lyra confirmed the Discord server build will happen across two days.
- The build is intended to be done once, as the foundational setup for the server.
- After the build, WHIMSEY AI is expected to handle ongoing operations, with public posting rules depending on whether autopilot is active.
- Lyra said X strategy and scheduling will be addressed after Discord is finished, because Discord is the current priority.
- Lyra requested a way for important conversations to be preserved.
- A private Discord archive channel named `#whimsey-ai-history` was established as the internal archive destination for important reports and summaries.
- The documentation standard was updated so important conversations can be preserved as dated session notes rather than relying on raw transcript permanence.

### Operating understanding confirmed in this session
- Discord is the current priority.
- X planning happens after Discord is built.
- The Discord build is treated as the first and last major manual build pass.
- WHIMSEY AI will maintain important internal records as session-style notes for meaningful conversations.

### Archive policy from this session
Important conversations should be preserved as structured reports with dates, titles, and summary sections. These notes belong both in the guide document and, when possible, in the private `#whimsey-ai-history` channel inside Discord.
